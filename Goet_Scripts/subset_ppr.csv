1811,1811-02-22,catholics of ireland mr wellesley poles circular letter,the hon j w ward,j w ward,j w ward,100,"said he rose, pursuant to notice, to move for such papers as might have a tendency to throw light on a latemeasure adopted in ireland had he understood that the production of these papers would be conceded, he should have felt it his duty to abstain from in anywise entering upon the question but as this was not the case, he conceived it necessary to say a few words, to induce the house to accede to his motion the house were aware that an act had been performed by the irish government, calculated to excite in ireland great anxiety and irritation an act which nothing but absolute necessity could, in his opinion, justify it was therefore incumbent on his majesty's ministers, if they wished to preserve the confidence of the country, to shew the existence of that necessity he certainly was not himself much inclined to repose confidence in the administration of the right hon gentleman opposite, and more especially as that administration regarded ireland because he conceived that right hon gentleman in that respect, to have proceeded on principles of the most mischievous tendency to both countries but when it was found that his majesty's servants rummaged the darkest pages of the statute book, in order to inflict pains and penalties on persons who, however erroneous they might be in any particular act, were generally and substantially as meritorious subjects as any in the king's dominions, it became necessary for parliament to interfere, and not to allow the security of a whole people to be endangered, without calling on those to whom the putting it to hazard was imputable for a full explanation of the motives by which they had been influenced it was as true as it was extraordinary, that the steps lately taken by the irish government had been preceded by no official statement, either on the part of that or of the british government, of existing disturbances in ireland on the contrary, the last notice that was taken of the state of ireland by the right hon opposite, in that house, was a boast of its tranquillity with respect to the paper which had been laid before the house, he meant the circular letter of the secretary of the catholic committee, it contained no justification of the conduct of government it merely ascertained the fact of the existence in ireland for a considerable time of a catholic delegation now, he apprehended, that the mere fact of the existence of such a delegation, did not justify government in the execution of a law such as that which had been enforced it was to him evident, that the legitimate object which the catholics of ireland had in contemplation, could be accomplished with much greater safety through the medium of a delegation than by a reference to the whole body of catholics in that country but admitting the supposition, to the truth of which he could not by any means assent, that the delegation was of an illegal nature, and had improper objects in view, the house ought to be informed whether his majesty's government had tried mild measures before they resorted to those of severity it was necessary that the house should know whether any communication had been made to the individuals presumed to have offended against the law, previous to the adoption of a step by which, if it were followed up, a very large number of person, indeed would be deprived of their personal liberty on the face of the paper which had been laid on the , there was nothing of an alarming nature on the contrary, it appeared to have been drawn up with a studious attention to mildness of expression, to decorous and respectful language, and with every necessary precaution to guard against any possible violation of the law the authors of it seemed to have been anxious to do only what was necessary to prosecute, in a legal way, the objects of their petition they expressly say, that no person, without a gross violation of the law, can be a representative or delegate engaged as we are in a struggle for our legal and constitutional rights, it is our duty, as well as our inclination and decided determination not to violate the spirit, nor even the letter of the law it was possible, however, that all these professions might be hollow and deceitful but of that, no trace appeared on the proceedings of the committee the house was in a state of profound ignorance on the subject, as nothing had been produced to justify the strong measure that had been had recourse to his majesty's ministers might, indeed, possess information of a different nature they might know that this declaration was nothing more than a pretext and that under this seeming regard for the laws, measures of a dangerous tendency were in contemplation but the house had no information of any such designs, and remained in profound ignorance on the subject from this measure, however, it appeared that ireland was in a most perilous state but it was impossible for a moment to conceive that the cause of this measure did not lie deeper than the letter of the secretary to the catholic committee for this letter was dated as far back as the 1st of january, and the circular letter of the secretary to the lord lieutenant was dated the 12th of this month so that it appeared there were six entire weeks between the two acts it was hardly possible to conceive that this letter of the secretary to the catholic committee could be the ground for the proceeding of the irish government, when it was considered, that so little stress did that government seem to lay on that letter, that the lord lieutenant did not think it worth his while to transmit a copy of it to his majesty's ministers it had even excited no feeling in the government here, for his majesty's ministers made no mention whatever of it in the late speech from the throne there was not one syllable in the speech which had the smallest relation to it, although this paper had been in existence for six weeks his majesty's ministers, under such circumstances, ought to be able to make out a good case they ought to be able to shew what powerful motive could induce them to remain quiet for six weeks, and then, all at once, to break out into the precipitate adoption of this harsh and unaccountable measure but he wished to call the attention of the house to a particular circumstance he had to ask, at what time particularly, this letter of the irish secretary came forth this paper was issued at a time when the accounts of the installation of the prince regent had barely arrived in ireland this was a most unlucky coincidence for the prince was, deservedly, in the highest degree popular in that country, and was considered, on all hands, to be strongly attached to the interests of his irish subjects for this measure, however, there was not the smallest ground to suppose that ministers had the countenance of his royal highness whether ministers were right or wrong in the adoption of this severe measure, in the present state of his information upon that subject, he should be very sorry to take upon him to decide but it was necessary that the house should have means to enable them amply to discuss and to decide upon the subject if it should turn out that the measure was necessary and justifiable, it might have the effect of turning the minds of the government to relax the system which they had been pursuing in ireland it was now four years since the right hon gent was called to the administration of these kingdoms and what was the result of his administration in ireland the state of ireland was every year growing worse and worse under his management it was every year becoming more and more a part not of our strength, but of our weakness he would ask, whether ministers expected to be able to continue this system whether they expected to be able, by their convention bills and similar measures, to govern that country he should be sorry if any thing he might say could have the least tendency to excite a spirit of discontent among the natives of ireland he was fully aware of the embarrassing situation in which he stood on the one hand, it was possible he might be supposed to wish to excite anxiety and alarm in that country and on the other, by maintaining a silence on the subject, it might appear as if he seemed to acquiesce in the justice and propriety of the irish system of government the administration of the country seemed now to be placed in the painful alternative of being obliged either to concede something to the demands of the people of ireland, or to put down the population of that country by the exercise of power while he said this, however, it was not his object to enter into any discussion at present on the subject for neither he nor the house were possessed of information to enable them with propriety to enter upon the subject his object was not a wish to embarrass administration and had he conceived that any thing this night spoken by him, could have the least tendency to effect such an embarrassment, it would have been buried in oblivion he thought, however, it was becoming in the house to show an anxiety for the fate of ireland, a greater anxiety than they had butherto shewn but while he blamed the spirit of intolerance that had been adopted in regard to ireland, he did not forget that the catholics themselves were, by their conduct, not altogether free from blame it was his most earnest wish that the catholics should abstain from all measures of a violent tendency for they might rest assured, that such measures, however much others might suffer from them, would return back on themselves in a tenfold degree while he recommended, therefore, tolerance to the administration, he could not help recommending forbearance to the catholics the hon gent, concluded with moving, that an humble address be presented to his royal highness the prince regent, praying that there may be laid before the house copies or extracts of such dispatches from the lord lieutenant of ireland to the secretary of state for the home department, as related to the circular letter of the right hon pole, chief secretary of ireland, to the chief magistrates and sheriffs of counties in that country upon this motion being proposed from the

1811,1811-02-22,catholics of ireland mr wellesley poles circular letter,mr yorke,yorke,c p yorke,100,"rose and observed, that though he could not concur in the whole, he was inclined to agree entirely with the concluding passage of the hon gents speech, in which he exhorted the house to an anxious consideration of the state of ireland, and that the utmost degree of toleration and relaxation that could possibly be adopted should be conceded there was no man in that house that could agree more cordially than he did in that sentiment, but he could not agree with the hon in that part of his speech where he charged the government of the country with adopting a system of intolerance towards ireland he must always deny the proposition, that because the house had not been inclined to agree to catholic emancipation, they were therefore to call the system intolerant so far from the system of his majesty's government towards ireland having been intolerant, he could venture to say, that the system pursued ever since his majesty had ascended the throne, had been in the highest degree ameliorating and tolerant they had, however, to lament, that there were great numbers of persons in ireland, who appeared not to be satisfied until that point was conceded to them, denominated catholic emancipation but until he could admit that that point should be granted them, he never could agree that the system had been intolerant the hon had himself admitted that this was not the time for the consideration of the catholic question, or for entering into the discussion of that subject but it were to be wished that the hon had confined himself to moving for the papers which he might conceive defective, and had avoided all discussion of topics connected with them before he proceeded to advert to these topics, he would state to the house the facts which had come to the knowledge of his majesty's ministers all that they knew was, that in consequence of a paper issued by a mr hay, who called himself secretary to the catholic committee it was thought advisable to issue the circular letter now before the house this paper carried on the face of it a violation of the existing laws of ireland this was not the time to discuss the merits of these laws it was sufficient to declare what was the law the convention act was declared to be expressly enacted for the purpose of preventing the assembly of delegates for any unlawful assembly, and offenders against the act were declared guilty of a high misdemeanour he would ask any person who read the paper now under discussion, whether it was not a decided offence against this act, and whether the sitting of any such assembly, as the body of delegates from the irish catholics, was not to be held an assembly against the convention act the hon had said that there was upon the face of it, an evident intention in drawing up this paper of wishing to avoid offending against the law he admitted that such intention was professed in certain passages of the paper but such passages did not at all alter the nature of that paper for how was it possible that men were to be sent as desired to join the catholic committee, without being appointed by an act of the body of catholics it might be contended, therefore, that the person who wrote that paper must have intended a violation of the laws, and that he was aware that he was acting in violation of the laws and therefore, without inquiring further, the government of ireland were prima facie and justifiably in the exercise of their duty, when they resorted to the measure under discussion it might be true, that that measure was not expedient, and it was upon the expediency of the measure that the conduct of the government most be justified looking therefore at the letter of mr hay, he maintained that the government of ireland could not have acted otherwise than it did, without allowing persons openly to violate the established law of the country but ministers were not in possession of all the information necessary to enable the house to judge of this measure in all its points and therefore, if all the papers moved for were granted on the present occasion, they would not answer the purpose of the hon he was therefore averse to the motion, because these papers were insufficient, and because it would be necessary to wait for still further papers, before the house could come properly to a discussion of the subject upon that ground he should give his negative to the motion the hon had thought fit to criticise the government of ireland, because the letter of the secretary to the catholic committee was dated the 1st of january, and the circular letter of the secretary to the lord lieutenant was dated on the 12th of february so that no notice appeared to have been taken of the former paper for six weeks but, according to the information which he possessed, the government of ireland knew nothing of that paper till within a short period of the issuing the proclamation although the letter of the catholic secretary bore date the 1st of january, he believed it was not circulated till a much later period, and therefore the observations on the conduct of the irish government did not seem to be entitled to much consideration the hon had also mentioned, what he conceived an unfortunate coincidence in the appearance of the letter of the irish secretary, at a time when the news of the regent's appointment had newly come to ireland and he took from thence an occasion of paying a welldeserved compliment, as he believed, to his royal highness every man who wished well to the interests of the united kingdom, ought to feel warmly for the interests of ireland and the illustrious person at the head of the government must be supposed to feel for those interests more warmly than other individuals could be supposed to feel the introduction, however, of every circumstance of this nature, must not only be considered peculiarly unfortunate at this time, but at all times it was also to be deplored, that gentlemen, who, he believed, had the glory and prosperity of their country sincerely at heart, should so often indulge in a tone and temper calculated to produce the greatest mischief that could possibly happen to ireland he did not, however, mean to say, that the hon who preceded him, was to be included in the description of gentlemen to whom this

admitted of no delay, and that the government of ireland was entitled to the thanks of the country for the measures which had been pursued now, if it was a case which admitted of no delay, how happened it that nothing had been done till the 12th of february the letter had been published in ireland at about the middle of january, and much discussion had at that time taken place on the question, whether or not it would be best to withdraw that letter, and submit the subject to the aggregate meeting that letter had been published in the newspapers how then could it be unknown to the irish government was it not known that lord castleross, son to lord kenmare, bad come from a distant part of the country to sit as a member of that committee with such information, how was it that the government of ireland, having paused from the middle of january to the 12th of february, should at length issue such a circular order on its own responsibility how was it that the information received by government could be such that it ought not to be communicated to the house, while it was of such a nature as to warrant so extraordinary a proceeding as that which had taken place the right hon had deprecated the tone in which irish matters were discussed on this subject he would say, as he had often said before, that those who were aggrieved had a right to complain and when a disposition was manifested, as at present, to oppress the people of ireland by reviving obsolete laws to deprive them of their rights, it became those who considered themselves as the guardians of those rights to speak with warmth and they were the best friends to this country who earliest called the attention of the house to their grievances, and pointed out the mismanagement of ministers with respect to the duke of richmond, he was in some instances entitled to much praise, yet had ireland many insults to complain of was not the making of one learned gentleman dr duigenan a right hon , immediately after he had been denouncing the whole body of the catholics as traitors the passing of an act to curtail the means of educating their clergy the appointing an hon to a high ostensible situation, who was particularly obnoxious to the catholic body, c were not these galling insults wantonly offered to the catholics of ireland as to what had been said of the system of toleration which was acted upon, and the conciliatory spirit evinced by ministers, he would say that, if seeking to act on such a principle, they must necessarily insult the catholics, by placing in a high situation a person by whom they had been most insulted and traduced, both in writings and in parliament why then had this been done if this evinced a spirit of conciliation with respect to what the gallant general had said, that there was not an iota of difference between the situation of the lower classes of the catholics and their protestant brethren, he would ask, if every catholic ought not to be able to hope, as well as every protestant, however humble his situation, that his son might possibly one day become lord high chancellor why ought not every father to be enabled to entertain such a hope, with as much appearance of reason as it might once have been indulged by the father of the present, and other lord chancellors, who, very much to their credit, had risen from humble situations in life why should a catholic be denied the hope of raising himself, as another noble lord had done, who originally had been but a woolcomber's son an honourable baronet had expressed himself content that the committee should remain as it was that, however, was not the wish of the ministers, they denounced it altogether as unlawful, or, what he should wish to know was the meaning of that part of the letter of mr secretary pole, where he stiles them an unlawful assembly sitting in dublin, and calling themselves, the catholic committee the hon here detailed the history of those proceedings which had caused the circular letter to be issued, which, he contended, were caused merely by a wish to take the general sense of the catholics on the question, whether or not it would be proper to present their petitions to parliament in the present session the object was to collect from those in the landed interest,whether or not it was proper the subject should be at present discussed and he should have thought it would have been the interest of government that it should be taken into consideration in such an assembly, rather than referred to an aggregate meeting the irish government had, however, thought it best, in order to preserve the peace, to put an obsolete act in force an act never before acted upon an act passed by a bigotted and intolerant government an act passed, in the time of mr pitt, the result of spleen and of disappointment that act, he would observe, had led to the abolishing of the irish parliament, and he warned them, lest, reviving it, they completed the ruin of their

there not only may be, but that there are political circumstances and changes, which in their operation can induce men, if not to change at least to modify even the most conscientious convictions what and does the right hon admit that catholic petitions must come before us with their due authority and respect that to ireland it ever was and will be the feeling of his government to extend lenity and forbearance the right hon then, is now almost the friend to a dispassionate consideration of the catholic claims i am not surprised that after the exertions of a successful ambition, like others of his predecessors, he has kicked down the ladder by which he scrambled up to political importance we have it now distinctly admitted, , by the bye, to his station by far different sentiments that he is willing to concede the loyalty of the great body of the catholics we this night hear from that source that the disturbances which agitate ireland have nothing to do with political questions or with catholic emancipation i congratulate the right hon , this country and ireland, on the revolution that has been effected in his opinions feeling it wholly unnecessary to comment on the causes of his conversion it is, however, altogether impossible to forget the libel, which the very formation of his administration pronounced upon the irish people it is impossible to forget that, during that administration, an appointment to the privy council was made an appointment which, even at the time, the right hon did not dare to justify of an individual dr duigenan, who in conversation, and in print, within these walls, and without them, had arraigned the catholics as traitors to the stale does the right hon fancy that his acts will perish can he suppose that the extorted admissions of this day can compensate for the exacerbated attacks of the former part of his administration a gallant general loftus on the other side, declares, forsooth, that the catholics of ireland labour under no disabilities but that they are in the enjoyment of all those rights with which men ought to be satisfied he who makes that statement is a general officer is he not, as be ought to be, proud of this distinction are the catholics to have no credit for the same feelings of generous ambition are they to exemplify loyalty as sincere heroism as conspicuous genius as commanding as their protestant fellowsoldiers can display, and then to be supposed dead to all the honourable impulses of life, undeserving of all those encouragements and rewards which a grateful country can bestow the gallant general has opened his mouth this night in this house is he not, as every member of a free state must be, proud of that distinction can the catholic enjoy that right how, at the very moment when his own act contradicts his statement, can he say that the catholic of ireland labours under no disability sir, the endeavours to justify the irish government for the course they have pursued he founds his opinion on the circular letter of the catholics, and the other information which the government here have received upon his own shewing then, namely, that the papers in his possession justify the irish government, he is bound to produce the correspondence for my part, i know of nothing that could justify any government, to use the words of my hon and able friend mr ward in rummaging into the statutes of the irish parliament, for an act, conceived in the darkest bigotry an act hatched in the revengeful disposition of those whose intolerance constituted their only pretension to power a pretension such as that which has recommended those persons who now fill the offices of state and government but then the right hon assures us that this harsh and restrictive act will be exercised mildly how, mildly if executed at all, it must he rigorous the law commands you to apprehend, and therefore if it be at all put in force, you cannot dispense with the apprehension what, then, is the true meaning of this term mildly why this affected forbearance, this assumed lenity it arises from this cause, that the ministers of the government have been stopped in their career of violence that the sanction of the prince regent has been refused to such a policy there has been a correspondence between the government here and that of ireland why is it not produced let his royal highness the prince regent appear to the country and the world in his true colours if the information be not produced now, it never will be in our possession the measure is altogether hushed it is completely quashed and, therefore, when we shall hereafter inquire, the answer will be, that inquiry is unnecessary, inasmuch as the measure was not acted upon the gentlemen opposite, on a former day, stated their previous ignorance of the intended measure of the irish government , whether he did not see the circular letter of the catholics before the departure of mr secretary pole from this country what no answer is the right hon as dexterous in his silence as in his eloquence the stated across the table, that he had not seen it extraordinary, that such a document, published in the irish papers early in the month of january papers received regularly by the irish secretary, should be unknown to the government here but surely the duke of richmond must have been acquainted with it indeed, mr secretary pole appears, as i have before stated in his presence, and therefore may now repeat in his absence, to be lordlieutenant in his own capacity sir it is now, it seems, stated, that the catholic committee, which was before innoxious, has assumed a new and dangerous character, the proof of which is to be found in their late discussions are we to trace this recent apprehension which the and mr pole have felt, to the fact of their names having been introduced and animadverted on in the late discussions of that body it is, indeed, a most unhappy combination of circumstances, that the government of the prince regent should be ushered into ireland, with a measure of harshness and coercion it was most eloquently remarked by an irish member of a late parliament, that the formation of the ministry, which the right hon had taken such means to establish, had, for the remainder of his majesty's reign, entombed the hopes of the catholics are the same instruments industriously at work, to propagate through ireland the thought, that their hopes are also to be entombed through the reign of his successor the right hon says, the law has provided against the catholic meetings the law does no such thing harsh and unconstitutional as that law was, it was directed against the objects of others the concessions to the catholics in 1793, admitted the claims of those who were stated to act for themselves and others but the convention bill was directed against the associations for parliamentary reform associations, amongst whom were some most distinguished persons, and a present member of this house not the least conspicuous i mean mr stewart now lord castlereagh , with an attempt to evade whilst professing to observe a law, which it was their determination to violate one would have thought, after all his affected respect for that body, that no such imputation would be presumed would it not be more proper, more correct, and more politic, to infer, even if a violation of law took place, that it did not spring from any predetermined disposition to commit an offence it has been said, sir, that these discussions in parliament have occasioned the irritation that prevails in ireland but it has been well and truly answered by my right hon friend near me, that unless these irritated feelings have the means of evaporation in debate, they will lead to conspiracy that, if the catholics cannot proclaim their grievances, in open day, they will brood over them in caverns and what will be the consequence although in imitation of the right hon i have already gone beyond the question, i must observe that he the had at his entrance into office given a bond, sealed with his honour, that he never would concede the catholic claims who sanctioned this act of the irish government it is most important to ascertain this, that the character of the head of the government here may stand clear, if in reality it is clear, and on that ground i shall vote for the production of these papers it is highly desirable that the government of england should stand unconnected with this proceeding, to see whether mr pole has been authorised to carry into execution this civil mode of arrest, or whether he has not been told that he has gone a step too far, and that part of his work must be undone i apprehend that this is what has actually taken place suppose the committee chose to hold its sittings in england, is there any law to prevent it then why should there be any such law in ireland i am anxious to see how the matter really stands, that blame may rest

to exemplify loyalty as sincere heroism as conspicuous genius as commanding as their protestant fellowsoldiers can display, and then to be supposed dead to all the honourable impulses of life, undeserving of all those encouragements and rewards which a grateful country can bestow the gallant general has opened his mouth this night in this house is he not, as every member of a free state must be, proud of that distinction can the catholic enjoy that right how, then, at the very moment when his own act contradicts his statement, can he say that the catholic of ireland labours under no

allowed a circumstance alluded to by the hon who spoke last, to pass unnoticed but in remarking upon it, he would preserve that good humour for which the hon himself was generally distinguished he had been most unhappy in his allusion to the transactions of 30 years ago he was even inaccurate as to the time, for it was not 30 years since the circumstances which he had so imperfectly described took place the fact was, that the irish, ill treated as they had been by great britain, asked for arms, and used them in your defence that gallant nation, having an account still to settle with you, generously lent its aid when it found you in difficulty such was their conduct then and had they since done nothing for you wherever your thunder has rolled east, west, south, or north have they been absent let that gallant people only stand neuter, and he would ask, where was the power and glory of great britain let them only remain neuter, and the strength and glory of britain was at an end the most glorious of your late triumphs have been not a little owing to the exertions of the gallant people whom the hon had this night traduced he wished to say this with good temper, as far as respected the hon , but at the same time with indignation, at finding within the walls of that house so much ignorance of the capabilities of ireland, either for aggression or defence and he was sorry to say that the hon was not the only one to whom this ignorance extended with regard to the question more immediately under consideration, he was anxious to know whether this act of the irish government had the sanction of the executive authority here for if it should go abroad that this proceeding had been approved by the regent, and his government here no no, he understood the right hon to have said, that he considered this as an act of great prudence on the part of the irish government, and that it was approved by the government here he wished then to know, whether the regent had instructed his ministers a cry of, order, order then proceeded to correct the statement of the right hon opposite, as to the purposes for which the convention act of 1793 had been framed the design then was to put down an armed association of united irishmen acting against the government, and having for its object the complete overthrow of parliament it had been stated by the administration of that day, that the society in question held communications with france, and that its design was to overturn the government the act was brought in upon the spur of the occasion to prevent the meeting of a congress at athlone, having, as had been alledged, these objects in view did the right hon then mean to say that any such object was to be imputed to the catholic committee, the assembly against which the act was now enforced he maintained that the right hon had not dared to state the facts correctly would he say that the object of this assembly was not to petition but to put down the parliament and redress their own grievances did he mean to say that it held any communication with france no he could not lay any such thing to their charge their object was clear they met in order to prepare a petition for the redress of their grievances in this their design was to refute the assertions of those who had maintained that the majority of the catholics did not desire emancipation they wished, as far as possible, to collect the unanimous sense of the catholic body, to shew the fallacy of such improbable statements the law therefore had by this act been violated a law, however, which ought to be repealed as soon as possible, and he intended to give immediate notice of a motion to that effect no, difficulty to petition existed in this country, which comparatively was possessed of every blessing why then should the difficulty exist in ireland, where there were so many grievances, and where the exercise of the right to petition was so much the more necessary but even if the law did apply, he did not think that under the circumstances it ought to have been put in execution if ireland was in a state so disturbed, notice ought to have been given to the government here and if they had notice here, then they were most culpable in not having stated this in the speech from the throne, of which the agitations of ireland ought to have been the most prominent feature if disturbances existed in ireland without the knowledge of ministers, their ignorance was criminal he concluded by deprecating the dangerous tendency of the system pursued by the minister, who came down with the speech to the house at the opening at every session, studiously abstaining from giving any thing like an accurate view of the state of ireland, and represented this conduct as directly opposite to his

house, if it had not been for what had fallen from the right hon that right hon gentleman had said, it was most unfortunate that irish business was always brought forward in a tone and temper rather calculated to irritate the feelings of the people of ireland, than to produce any beneficial effect now, he denied the justice and the truth of that assertion he did not wish to make use of any harsh expression, but he must say that such an assertion could only have arisen from an ignorance of the subject if the feelings of the irish people were irritated, it was not occasioned by any thing which had been said in that house were the people of that country so stupid as not to feel their misfortunes until they were told of them he was astonished at such a remark so lately as the 20th of june last, the commissioners in their speech, had said his majesty was sorry that the pressure of the times had rendered it necessary that some addition should be made to the burdens of ireland but that they were so judiciously, chosen, as not to interfere with the growing prosperity of that country but where was the proof of that growing prosperity was it to be found in the fact, which he defied the right hon to disprove, that the whole of, the revenue of ireland fell short, by a million sterling, of i the payment of the interest of her funded debt, without expending a shilling towards her establishment had that been occasioned by their speeches as well might it be said, that the difficulties under which this country at present laboured, were occasioned by inflammatory speeches delivered in that house, as that the misfortunes of ireland were attributable to such a source the people of ireland felt their situation let not that feeling be pushed too far, lest it might induce those who were at present well affected to the connection with england, to consider it as any thing rather than a benefit with respect to what had fallen from an hon member mr fuller he was not surprised at his mistaking a point of order but certainly the assertion, that, 30 years ago, the people of ireland turned the arms with which they had been intrusted, against this country, astonished him not a little it was another proof of the little attention paid to the history of ireland at the time to which the hon member alluded, so far from any seeds of rebellion existing in the country, the parliament of ireland suffered a considerable portion of the military establishment to be sent abroad in the service of great britain, while the volunteers, who were now branded as traitors, kept the enemy from the shores of ireland the right hon , in the conduct pursued by the irish government, the law was with them, and he pledged himself to the fact but he could not so readily agree that the law was on their side and, for that reason, he wished to have full information on the subject the act which was to be enforced specified the particular kind of meeting which came within its meaning if any individuals met under certain circumstances, then such meeting should be deemed an unlawful assembly, and the persons constituting it be guilty of a high misdemeanor now the information he wanted was, whether the bodies mentioned in the circular letter were really about to meet for the purpose of considering the propriety of presenting their petition, and for no other object because the last clause said, that the provisions of the act shall not extend to the right of petition therefore the mind and intention of those persons should be ascertained if the letter sent round to the catholics was merely colourable if it was only a pretence to cover other views then he would agree that those who were assembled under it might be deemed guilty of having met unlawfully but they ought to know how the facts really stood before they attempted to give a decisive opinion the circular letter of the lordlieutenant denominated the catholic committee an unlawful assembly before a single person appeared to have been elected, in the manner specified by the act the whole proceeding had been grounded on the letter addressed to the catholics throughout ireland, although, perhaps, no act had been done, nor any persons associated in consequence of it certainly some satisfactory evidence should have been first obtained before the measure was resorted to it might be asked, would you, then, permit the illegal act to be committed, and not endeavour, in the first instance, to prevent it undoubtedly, not but he would have proper information, and then he would be justified in acting he however defied any person, even the right hon opposite, to prove them an illegal assembly, by any act they had performed he knew not on what circumstance the irish government relied, to make out the charge of illegality against them, and the house should be in possession of the most complete information before they sanctioned it there was another part of mr pole's letter, which directed the arrest of individuals, and ordered their commitment, unless bail was given he had not made up his mind as to the legality of such a proceeding and he would ask, what had been done by those persons that could clearly decide whether their conduct was or was not illegal and whether mr pole was or was not justified they only asked for information to guide them on the subject but the right hon , that if the extracts moved for were granted, they would not answer the end proposed now, he did not know that and perhaps some parts of those extracts, which the right hon considered of no importance, might, on examination, appear to be worthy of particular attention he had also stated, that when the business was fairly examined, the irish government would be found, not only borne out in point of law, but decidedly supported on the ground of expediency but when he made that assertion, did he bring forward documents to prove it he told the house that the irish government were completely justified in what they had done but why did he not accompany that declaration with proofs of the fact no, the house were called upon to decide on the subject, with what had been already laid before them, coupled with the mere declaration of the minister but he would not trust to the assertion of any minister, in the present alarming situation of ireland and if more information were not granted on the subject at some future period, the house must come to a decision on the conduct of the irish government, with the little they had procured it had been observed, that the manner in which the debate was conducted would be productive of mischief in ireland before that was asserted, he wished the british part of the representation would pay more attention to the affairs of ireland it had been common to leave that important business to the hands of a very few irish members, which he conceived was improper and unwise it would afford a sensible pleasure to the irish people, to behold the british members studying their interests and no act could ever make ireland a contented country till her affairs were more particularly attended to as long as the present system was persevered in, she

matter which, he no doubt, would be regarded as highly interesting to the feelings, and of the greatest importance to the interests of that house, and of the country this position, when he should state what he had to offer to the house, would not, he trusted, adroit of doubt or contradiction when future historians, after the party heats and political animosities of recent times, have been consigned to that silent oblivion to which the animosities and feuds of former periods have been already consigned when these historians, removed from the period, and uninfluenced by the circumstances under which the events they will have to record have taken place, shall come with an impartial judgment, and unprejudiced feeling, to narrate the transactions of recent times, they will, notwithstanding the impressions which the influence of party animosity might have made to the contrary, in taking a review of the transactions of the present reign, conclude, that under no circumstances, and in no times, have the people of any country been more loyal or more affectionately attached to the person of their sovereign than the people of this country have been, during a long series of years to his present majesty if they should only look back to the period of the last 25 years, they would find that the love and attachment of his subjects were not given alone to the king during the interesting period of youth or the prosperous and successful portion of his reign, but that they increased in times of personal affliction and infirmity and, instead of suffering diminution, had been considerably strengthened, as his faculties and health had unhappily declined if, then, the people of this country had delighted in the prosperities of his majesty's government if they had ever felt the deepest interest in the health of their sovereign if, in the days of his strength, they rejoiced at his happiness, and in the hours of his affliction and infirmity, they sympathised in his sorrows and mourned over his sufferings, they had a just right to know, that no foul trick had been, at any time during the existence of such respectful devotion to their monarch's interest and person, practised by his majesty's ministers, either towards the king, or towards the people if he could be able to shew, that according to a statement made by a right hon yorke on a former night, the king had not had fair play, that neither the king nor the people had fair play shewn them by the administration, of which that right hon formed a part, he trusted that he should do enough to excite the indignation of that house, and to induce them peremptorily to call for an efficient and full inquiry into the whole of the case this he would confidently undertake to shew, if that house, by agreeing to his preliminary motion, should put him in a condition to substantiate the charge it must be in the recollection of the house, that when the calamity had first falden upon his majesty in 1788, though there were abundant rumours afloat upon the subject, yet such was the tender affection and ardent zeal of his faithful people, that they could not persuade themselves of the fact, that his majesty was seriously suffering under the malady given out by rumour, until the truth of the representation was but too fully confirmed by the report of the physicians when it was afterwards established, by proof, that the king's mind was unsound, that his mental faculties were deranged, and that he was incapable of personally exercising his royal functions, the two houses resorted to such measures as they thought proper for supplying the defect of the royal authority but, on its being announced to parliament by the noble lord, who at that period filled the high office now held by lord eldon, that he had it in command from his majesty to acquaint parliament that he had sufficiently recovered to authorise a confident expectation, that after a short interval he should be enabled personally to resume his royal functions such was the delicacy, such the affection and veneration of the two houses of parliament towards the sovereign, that though they had made very considerable progress with the measures they were to adopt, they immediately suspended all proceedings upon them, and waited in fond and anxious expectation for the full restoration of his majesty whatever might have been the differences of opinion whatever the party heat and political animosity which characterised these differences as to the mode of supplying the temporary deficiency, all feelings of personal consideration or party hostility instantly subsided into one common sense of gratification, at the prospect that auspiciously burst upon the nation and every eye glistened with joy and gladness at the approaching restoration of the king to his reason and his throne when about twelve years afterwards, in the year 1801, the indisposition of his majesty was again announced to the public by a notification from his physicians, that notification was so cautiously guarded, that, if the nation had not been aware of the malady with his majesty had been previously afflicted, it would have been impossible for any man to know, from any thing that appeared upon the face of the statement of the physicians, that the king, though undoubtedly indisposed, was not still competent to the exercise of all his royal functions yet, from what had recently come to the knowledge of the public, by the examination of the physicians before the lordscommittee, it was fully established, that, at that very period, he king was of unsound mind on the 22nd of february, 1801, the first notice of his majesty's illness was published, though it was now well known that his majesty's mental health was then impaired that he was incapable of his royal functions that, to use the expressions of one of his physicians, his judgment was in eclipse yet by reference to their journals, they would find, that two days after, namely, on the 24th of february, 1801, a commission was issued, signed with the king's sign manual it was not to be forgotten, too, that in the beginning of that year, 1801, a remarkable political event had taken place after a long struggle, and a considerable period of adherence to power, mr pitt at length thought proper to resign the seals of office which had been committed to him so long as seventeen years before a noble lord sidmouth, not now a member of that house, was then selected as successor to mr pitt and after a certain period, took his seat in that house the precise day he could notcall to mind on his reelection, after entering upon office it was not material to fix the precise day, but of this he was certain, that on the 10th of march the bulletins ceased to be issued he would leave it to the house to determine, whether the bulletins had been discontinued for any other purpose than to impress the public with an opinion that the king was fully recovered whereas, it was now, clear, that he was not then recovered nay, more, that he had afterwards a considerable delaspe and yet, notwithstanding all this, the functions of the executive were uninterruptedly exercised, and various important acts of state performed, for either of which no constitutional sanction could possibly have been procured from the king, in the state of mental incapacity in which unfortunately his majesty then was yet such was the delicacy of the two houses of parliament upon the subject, and of the public, that no notice had been taken of the matter, except by one hon no longer a member of that house, who had given notice of a motion respecting the state of his majesty's health this notice having been seen in the notice bookby a right hon friend of his mr sheridan, that right hon friend conceiving such a motion to be improper and unseasonable, on the day in which it was to have been brought forward, moved that the house should adjourn which motion was seconded by mr pitt, who happened to come into the house whilst his right hon friend was proposing it, and who at the same time stated, that he would take care that proper notice should be supplied to the house of the state of his majesty's health, if that should be found necessary in the year 1804, only three years after, his majesty was again afflicted with the same malady he was taken ill on the 14th of february, and on the following day it was announced to the public the object of his motion was to bring the circumstances attending that indisposition of the king under the consideration of the house the motion with which he meant to conclude would be, for a committee to examine the lordsjournals for the evidence of the physicians respecting his majesty's state of health in 1s04, and to report the same to the house this he meant only as preliminary to another inquiry, in the course of which, if the house should grant his motion, he would pledge himself to prove what he should distinctly charge and assert before he sat down it would appear by the evidence which he wished to have produced, that of one of the physicians dr heberden who had attended his majesty in 1804, and was also in attendance upon him in his present malady, that the period of his majesty's illness, in the former instance, continued from the 14th of february to the 23d of april in that year his majesty, it appeared, on the latter day attended a council in person, which the physicians considered as evidence of his being then fully restored the bulletins however had ceased on the 22d of march, and yet it was not till the 23d of april that the physician, to whose evidence he had alluded, looked upon the king's recovery complete, of which he considered his attendance in council a sufficient demonstration that physician also had continued in attendance upon his majesty until the 23rd of april it was to that period of the year 1804, therefore, that the inquiry, which he proposed to institute, would be particularly directed with respect to what had taken place in 1801, it was not his intention, nor indeed did he think it necessary, to propose any investigation, as well because many of the persons who were implicated in the transactions of that period were now no more, as because none of those others who were concerned in them, were now in office or ill a situation to excite suspicion, or to give alarm to the public, lest they should on any future occasion be guilty of the same conduct but as he found, that one of the persons, who, under the late act for establishing a regency, was to be of the queen's council, had been lord high chancellor in 1801 and also in 1804 when he knew that a noble lord, now a member of the other house lord sidmouth was at the head of the administration in both instances when he perceived a right hon opposite mr yorke who was a secretary of state in 1804, and a noble lord under the gallery lord castlereagh, who was also in his majesty's cabinet at that period, he was persuaded that the house would feel how necessary it was, either with a view to precaution or for the purpose of example, to enable him to prove his assertions or, on the other hand, if his assertions were not founded, to give the noble and honourable persons he had mentioned an opportunity to disprove them with regard, however, to the right hon opposite mr yorke, or the noble lord castlereagh under the gallery, he did not mean to impute any blame to them because he could not possibly know whether they were guilty but whether guilty or not, that would come out in the inquiry which he proposed to institute to john lord eldon, however, now as then lord chancellor, and to lord viscount sidmouth, who was at that period at the head of his majesty's government, he thought, in his conscience, that the whole blame was justly imputable this he was not only prepared to assert, but to prove lord eldon was lord high chancellor in 1801, when a great and important political change was effected he was also lord high chancellor in 1804, when another important political change had also taken place a change certainly not brought about in the same manner as that in 1801, when mr pitt, looking to the successor that was to replace him, contemplated the prospect of retaining all the political influence, if not the official power, from which he was professing to retire the change in 1804 was of a very different description indeed on that occasion the two great parties, which had been so long in opposition to each other in that house, had for some time acted in unison under the guidance of the two greatest political leaders that had ever distinguished themselves, upon any arena, in opposition to the government of that day they took their stand upon one of the great measures of that administration, and mustered upon a division within fifty of the majority which supported the ministerial measure upon that symptom of his declining influence in that house, mr addington thought it prudent to resign his office in a manner certainly not conformable to the fashion of more recent times, when ministers, after finding themselves repeatedly in minorities, still ventured to cling to office, and dared to retain their places but the projected union did not take place pitt consented to come into office without the support of those with whom he was solicitous to cooperate lord eldon, too, consented to accept office in that administration and thus, after many years of political hostility and contention, when the hopes of the nation were anxiously anticipating an union of the two great parties, under the auspices of mr pitt and mr fox, for the salvation of their common country, these fond expectations were frustrated by the acceptance of office, on a system of exclusion, by the administration of 1804 during this anxious and critical period, lord eldon was the only person who had access to his majesty whether that noble lord exerted himself in the interviews he had with his sovereign, to promote the union so greatly desired by all classes, and byno person, he believed, more than by mr pitt himself, or not, it was impossible for him to know that was a circumstance which must rest in the noble lord's own bosom, as mall probability there had been no witnesses present at any of these interviews but he must admit, however, that that noble lord had not shewn himself so decided in his opinion upon the subject, as the right hon who was at that time attorneygeneral that right hon had thought proper to declare, that such an union would have been a disgrace to both mr pitt and mr fox that they could not, in case it had taken place, meet at a council without being ashamed of themselves and yet that right hon had thought proper to continue in administration with mr pitt, who had been in heart guilty of wishing such an union to take place yet it was unquestionable that mr pitt wished for that union in his heart, which his attorneygeneral could not possibly reconcile to his notions it was equally well known, too, that aright hon opposite, mr canning was equally zealous for that union, with the great leader of the party, mr it was true the right hon might say that he would not, as attorneygeneral, have known more of what was in the contemplation of the great leaders of that day, than the humble individual i then addressing the house but it was scarcely possible that the attorneygeneral should not have known facts, which came to hiss knowledge, within a few days after they had taken place in calling the attention of the house to i the circumstances of this period, he must beg of gentlemen to bear in mind that lord eldon bad been particularly questioned in the mouse of lords in 1804, as to the state of his majesty's health addington now lord sidmouth had also been questioned in that house by an hon member sir robert lawley on the same subject when first asked about the state of the king's health by that hon member, it would be remembered, that mr addington said that he thought his best course would be, not to give any answer but when pressed for an answer by mr fox, he said, that there was no necessary suspension of any necessary act of the executive functions and when still further pressed by mr pitt, that there was no necessary suspension of any of the royal functions and added, that he stated this, not upon his own authority, but upon the opinions and authority of the physicians meaning thereby, no doubt, that he had personally no access to the king on the 6th of march, the lord chancellor slated in the house of lords, that he had been with his majesty on the 5th, and also on the 4th, and after having explained to him the nature of a bill then pending, for alienating certain crown lands to the duke of york, that his majesty had commanded him to signify his assent to that bill on the 9th of march, a commission signed by the king was issued and when lord eldon was asked on that day, whether he had personal knowledge of the state of the king's health, using a figure, not unfrequent with that noble lord, and which is so characteristic of his eloquence, that he would have his right hand severed from his body sooner than desert his sovereign, he declared, that he would never think of doing an act so unconstitutional, if the king was incompetent that he was aware of what he was doing, and would take the whole of the heavy responsibility upon himself now, this was what his motion was intended to ascertain, that he should therefore confidently call upon the house to put him in a situation to bring that responsibility to issue he was ready to take upon himself to say, that his majesty was at that time unsound in mind, and to a period long posterior that he was incompetent to his functions that his reason was clouded, and his judgment eclipsed yet whilst the king was still unhappily in that state, lord sidmouth, on the 26th of march, brought down a message to that house from the king from the king, deranged as he was in his mental competence, and incapable of exercising any sound discretion this fact he should broadly assert and he therefore called upon the friends of that noble lord to place him and themselves in a situation to answer to this charge to say, then, that they were prepared to share the responsibility, would be worse than idle it would not be sincere he called upon the house of commons, then, to put him in the situation to prove his charges it was necessary for the character of the individuals concerned that they should be disproved, if not founded, and it was material to the public that they should be proved if true because, if the case was as he had stated it, the public had been imposed upon, and might again be grievously imposed upon, if that should not be prevented by the result of the inquiry he proposed upon a question of such importance to the vital interests of the constitution of the country, parliament must have expected and should have required much more satisfactory proof of his majesty's recovery than the bare assertions of physicians when a king of england had been placed in a situation not to be capable of performing his royal functions when reduced to a state of health in which, a private individual would not be allowed the disposal of his property when he had been under restraint when he had been taken out in a morning to be shewn to his subjects under colour of being recovered, and had been carried home in the evening to be placed again under restraint when his incapacity had been solemnly voted by the two houses of parliament was it right or proper, he would ask, that a king of england, after having been in such a situation, should have the important fact of his recovery established on no better authority than the statement of physicians in the committee he had put a question to dr heberden, whether the king was so far recovered as to be competent to attend to all his public and private business to this dr heberden answered, yes another physician answered, also, yes and dr willis, in a roost positive manner, answered, most assuredly but he would contend, on the contrary, that his majesty was not at the time so far recovered as, in the case of an individual in private life, would warrant the superceding a commission of lunacy the lord chancellor, he had heard, would not, as he had publicly declared in court, take the opinions of physicians on an application to supercede a commission of lunacy he would hear the opinions of the physicians, and upon a consideration of them would form his own judgment that noble lord knew well the difficulty of proving the perfect recovery of persons in such a complaint he well knew that many individuals so affected appeared in every other respect in perfect mental health, until a certain chord was touched, upon which their delusion turned, when the whole fabric, raised by their morbid cunning to conceal their defect, instantly was overthrown indeed, that noble lord, in the course of his practice as a barrister, if he was correctly informed, had personal experience of the difficulty of ascertaining the complete recovery of a patient from such a malady, and of the fallacy of the appearances which sometimes seem to indicate a perfect reestablishment it had been stated by that noble lord himself that in the course of his practice it had happened to him to have to make an application to the court of chancery to supersede a commission of lunacy upon such grounds, taken both as to time and quality, as left no doubt upon the mind of that learned lord of the restored security of the person on whose behalf he made the application the commission was superseded, and it was not long after, when the individual came to thank him for his success, that he was convinced by his manner, that the motion, in which he had succeeded, was the greatest injury that could have happened to the unfortunate man he was justified, therefore, in assuming that the noble lord would not supersede a commission of lunacy without the fullest proof of the perfect restoration of the patient would the house, then, or ought they to be satisfied with a statement of the physicians, that his majesty was competent on any particular day, or on any hour of any day, to the personal exercise of his functions would such a statement, in the case of an individual, be admitted by lord eldon in the court of chancery, as sufficient to set aside a commission of lunacy he had taken much pains to ascertain by what rules the practice of the court of chancery was regulated in such cases in the case of the attorney general versus panther and others, which was an issue out of chancery to the court of king's bench, to try the validity of a will, made under the following circumstances the testatrix, frances barton, had been previously disordered in her mind, but at the time of making her will, was proved by the attesting witnesses to be of sound disposing mind no imputation was cast upon the character of the witnesses the jury found in favour of the will but the decision not being satisfactory to lord kenyon, an application was again made to lord thurlow in that argument it was laid down by that noble and learned lord, that if derangement be alledged, it must be proved but that if any lucid intervals have existed, the bulk of proof was to shew the soundness and sanity at the time of the lucid interval and that such evidence must be as strong and as demonstrative as was the proof of the previous derangement that it must go to the habit and general demeanour of the person, and not depend upon the existence of any temporary selfpossession from this doctrine laid down by that noble and learned lord, it was obvious that before the lucid interval could be recognised, the disease must be entirely gone and dissipated that there must remain no latent spark, which might revive the phrensy or recal the delusion that the interval should not have been produced by medical expedients for certain occasions, and particular business at the time when dr heberden represented his majesty as having been so well as at any time of any day to be capable of business, another of the physicians admitted that he was liable to hurries, but that business generally had the effect of restoring him to calmness and composure why, this very effort of business was what he considered as one of the medical expedients he could have wished to crossexamine these physicians on their evidence a laugh from the treasury bench he could have wished to ask dr heberden, whether, when he said that the king was perfectly well after the 23d of april, he did not know that dr simmons was attending his majesty that that physician continued for some time after in attendance on the king, and had employed even other attendants near his majesty's person if he had asked these questions, and dr heberden had answered, as he knew he must have done, in the affirmative, would the right hon gentleman scoff at such a crossexamination he would ask the lord chancellor himself, too, whether at the time when he, in the name of the king, exercised certain acts of the executive authority, he was not aware of the controul exercised over his majesty whether he had not himself exercised a controul over his majesty whether he had not possessed himself of the keys of his majesty's private escrutoire, which he refused to give up these were facts of which he had himself no doubt, but which ought to be inquired into the king, he contended, was under controul when the change took place in 1804 and when mr pitt went into his majesty, dr simmons went out was it not then material for lord eldon, for lord sidmouth, and all the others concerned, to place him in the situation to prove all the charges he had made, or to take the opportunity of ac quitting themselves of all imputation by disproving them but there were, in the manner in which the restraint was imposed upon his majesty, circumstances of aggravation which rendered it peculiarly necessary for that house to inquire into the case he was assured, that the controul over the sovereign had been exercised in a manner, which, if known to the public, would excite their sorrow and indignation, and convince them that the king had not been fairly treated if they loved the king if they were attached to their sovereign if they respected the royal office and authority they were bound by every feeling of humanity, and every principle of duty, to inquire into this matter if the individuals concerned should not disprove these statements, which, without the fear of contradiction, he submitted to the consideration of the house, he was afraid the kingly office would be brought into disrepute even lord eldon himself, in the case of ridgway and darling, in 1s02, carried, as he then acknowledged, the power of the court farther than it was carried in the time of lord hardwicke in that case the noble lord declared, that the care of the court extended not alone to insane persons, but also to weak and infirm persons, to save them from any loss or injury to their property and observed, that no person could see the lady without perceiving the necessity of throwing care around her upon this he would ask the noble lord, what was the state of the king could any person see him without perceiving the necessity of throwing care around him in the case of the lady to whom he had alluded, lord eldon asserted, that every one would see the propriety of providing care for her he did not feel it necessary to come to parliament in her case he provided for the care of her property but he suffered the king to give away the property of the crown, at a time when he must have been aware that his majesty was not in a state that would warrant the chancellor in superseding a commission of lunacy in the case of a subject for himself, he had no doubt that his majesty had at the time been able to hold rational conversations he was convinced that he could then, at intervals, converse as rationally as he himself could at present yet in his conscience he believed, that the mind of the king was at present much more sound than it was in 1804 or in 1801 he must say, too, that the king had not had fair play, when hurried out, and driven to the east and to the west, as they might all recollect, to be exhibited to his subjects and afterwards taken home in the evening, to be placed under the restraint from which in the morning he was withdrawn for the purpose of this public exhibition yet all this had been done, and lord eldon was a principal party to the transaction was it not well known that persons might appear of sound mind, until the corner be explored which contains the ground of their delusion in the case of collins, lord eldon held, that before he could supersede the commission, the recovery should be fully established by the physicians, as to the whole competence of the party, and under all circumstances in that case, the noble lord quoted a case, in which he proceeded with lord thurlow, when that person was chancellor, to get a commission superseded for a party whom after many interviews and various conferences he thought perfectly well, till he came to thank him for his success, when he gave such evident proofs of insanity as made him regret his success if the noble lord was deceived in that case till the circumstance of success produced marks of the delusion, had he, he would ask, ascertained whether there were any topics upon which particularly his majesty's complaint hinged had he, in order to convince himself of the recovery, sought out those topics, and submitted them to his majesty's mind or had he studiously abstained from them, and yet ventured to pronounce his majesty well, while he knew he was yet under the controul of dr simmons and his attendants lord eldon was the onlyone of the ministers who saw his majesty during his illness in 1804 addington resigned whilst his majesty was in that state he could prove all this, and required only the opportunity of doing it if he should, in establishing the charges he urged against lord eldon, succeed, it would be necessary to take some proceeding in consequence, in order to prevent that noble lord from remaining in her majesty's council when his inquiry should be concluded, it would be for the house to decide what further measures would be necessary to be taken the hon gentleman concluded by moving, that a committee be appointed to inspect the journals of the house of lords, with relation to any proceedings in the present session, touching his majesty's illness, so far as relates to the state of his majesty's health in the year 1804, and to make report thereof to the house",LIB,mp,none,uk.proc.d.1811-02-25.2.1.1,uk.proc.d.1811-02-25,5423,2,1,2,1810-11-01,4.5,13,NA,NA,0,0

the hon felt bound in duty to his sovereign, to the house, and to himself, to take the earliest opportunity of stating his sentiments upon this question he should not be deterred, delicate and important as the question was, by any delicacy from performing that which he conceived a duty, however painful it might be to him he must admit, that the hon had not by any means attempted to colour his statement invidiously he would go further, and say, that if the persons in power at the time to which the hon had referred, could so far forget their allegiance to their sovereign and their duty to the country, as to abuse the confidence reposed in them, for the purpose of turning it to their advantage or to the injury of their country, they were guilty of a constitutional crime which could not be defended, and which must hold them up to the severest account the hon had, he would not say illiberally, but perhaps naturally, directed his particular attention to the conduct of lord eldon, who held the same high situation then as at present but he lord castlereagh could not, as a man of honour, forbear claiming his full share of the responsibility, and of the blame, if there was any which, however, he denied this was not a mere bravado for he would tell the house, why he considered himself as equally responsible it was because he was conscious that none of the ministers would have gone up and taken his majesty's pleasure on any business, unless the whole of the cabinet, upon the opinions of the physicians, had been convinced that he was in such a state of health as to have rendered it criminal in them to refrain from doing that for which they were now accused the hon was greatly mistaken, if he thought he could prove the facts stated he was enabled to disprove many of his assumed facts, and to convince the house that lord eldon was not the only minister of the crown who had access to his majesty from the 12th of february to the 23rd of april the opinions of the whole of the ministers were taken, and he assured the house that not one of his colleagues would have had access to his majesty, if, in the judgment of the whole taken collectively, it was not only thought justifiable, but necessary to do the acts charged if they had not done those acts, they would be justly held criminal in a constitutional point of view that he should be prepared to prove what he had asserted, was beyond a doubt with respect to the precise period at which competence for business was to be presumed, the definition of the hon was much too large as it would cover not only the period of the least remains of disease, but even that of recovery this, however, was not a foundation on which he would rest much he had better grounds to stand upon the hon was then in 1801 as now, an ornament of the house and these facts were then fully in his view hear hear from mr whitbread, and others he hoped the hon would not alledge in his reply, that it was not perfectly understood then, that his majesty's disorder was of the same description as that with which he had been afflicted in 1789, and which led to the parliamentary proceeding of that period the fact that dr simmons had been called in was notorious and if the hon regarded these things in the same light as he did now, it was a gross neglect of duty in him not to have at that time called ministers to account why did the hon pass over the if this doctrine was to prevail if they were to listen to such accusations preferred six or seven years after the date of the transactions, he would have a just right to charge the hon and the house with a design to entrap ministers having made these preliminary observations, he would now come to the main basis of his defence the nature of the evidence of the physicians taken before the lords was notorious the matter, therefore, was already substantially before the house, and they had to judge whether such a prima facie charge was made out against the administration of 1801 , as to call for a parliamentary inquiry with regard to dr heberden's evidence, if it was to be taken merely as given before the lords, it might be considered as affording some colour, though not a real foundation, for this charge , that he had been called in on the 12th of february, and that his majesty presided at council on the 23d of april the interval he considered as the extent of the disease when pressed with the question whether the malady extended over the whole period, he answered, no that a few days before the 23d of april, his majesty was competent to transact public business the hon might think that, except for these few days before the 23d of april, his majesty was not competent and the implication would, perhaps, have been justifiable enough, it there had been no explanation he wished, however, to have this evidence of dr hebcrden compared with that which he gave before the house of commons he did not desire to cast any reflection on dr heberden he had known him long, had been educated with him at the same university, and he believed him to be a fair and honourable man a man of his high character would no doubt give the same evidence before a committee of the house of commons, as he would on oath before the lords his evidence before both was therefore to be taken into account, and the testimony in the one case must be admitted as explanatory of that in the other the idea of a cross examination of the physicians came with a bad grace now from the hon the house would recollect, that the hon had been a member of the committee of that house before which the physicians had been examined, and might have crossexamined dr heberden before that committee, if he had so chosen but what was dr heberden's evidence there being asked, whether he recollected the time when the bulletins ceased in 1804 he answered, no but in reply to a question, whether they were discontinued in order to shew that his majesty was competent to perform the duties of his situation he said, that they were now, the bulletins ceased on the 22d of march, five weeks before the 23d of april the hon he hoped, would do him the justice to say that it was not his practice to evade an accusation, nor to argue a point unfairly the evidence, then, of dr heberden, taken together, was, that his majesty was fully competent, to the discharge of the royal functions on the 22d of march this disposed of the charge so far as it applied to the period between the 22d of march, and the 23d of april but the hon gent had called upon him to account for the state of his majesty's health in the intervening period between the 12th of february and the 22d of march, and this he was fully perpared to do he hoped he should rescue the government of that day from any design of abusing their situations, so as to take advantage of the circumstances which then arose and that he should show, that had they acted otherwise than as they had done, they would furnish a case at which he ought to hide his head, and blush for the pusillanimity which had so unjustifiably and unnecessarily thrown the kingdom into difficulties the house could not forget the difficulties of that day the parliament was then sitting they witnessed the conduct of ministers, and the acts which were then executing their noninterference alone was a guide to the councils of the administration though they had not the direct authority of parliament for what they had done, yet there was enough in the view of the parliament and the country to enable them to judge of the conduct of the administration, and the ministers might easily collect what was the opinion of parliament he did not intend, however, to come down now to parliament with that protection for he would confess that he expected something more than a cold acquittal on the 12th of february, the first bulletin issued on the 27th the subject of his majesty's illness was noticed by an hon baronet in parliament, and then only, with a view to a particular point it was enough for him to stale, that on the 22d and 27th of february, the cabinet examined the physicians, and the physicians had declared that his majesty was competent to perform the royal functions and here he referred to the difference between the year i804 and the present period, with regard to his majesty's indisposition when parliament lately met, it could proceed to no business till it had taken steps, ex necessitate rei , to ascertain the want of the royal authority, and to supply the deficiency but in 1804, parliament was sitting, and in that difficult period was the house prepared to say that the ministers, merely on account of an indisposition in his majesty of a few days or weeks, ought to come down to the house and suspend the whole course and exercise of the legislative functions they had this to consider, and when it was recollected that the country was then menaced with invasion, and that the most important measures to meet and defeat it, were in progress, he trusted the house would approve of their determination on the 22d of february, as he had said, the physicians were examined, and had stated that a very material improvement had taken, place in his majesty's health and again, on the 27th, they declared that a further improvement had taken place being asked, whether they thought his majesty competent to any act of government, if necessary, they answered, that, though it would be better to postpone any act, if the public service would allow it, yet his majesty was competent this was the judgment of the physicians, who were to be understood, in respect of competency, as speaking in the same way as they would of any private individual, imagining that his majesty was as competent to discharge the royal functions, as a private individual to transact his common affairs, or make a deed which an honest man would subscribe as a witness, and which would be valid in law, upon an inquiry into all the circumstances but to disarm the question of some of the jealousy attached to it, his lordship, while he admitted the importance of the royal functions, remarked that the public interest was always secured by the circumstance, that the minister was at all events responsible for every act of the government his lordship mentioned that he had made a memorandum of the answers of the physicians at the time of their examination on the 27th of february, and therefore he had been enabled to speak to it more accurately the cause of the desire of the postponement by the physicians, was the danger of a protracted discussion to a recovering mind notwithstanding the competency of his majesty on the 22d and 27th of february, no act of government had been done by him till the 5th of march the hon carried his notion of incompetency so far, that he would have an instant suspension declared, though the derangement was merely incidental, and likely to be but of very short continuance but on the 27th of february, when the subject was mentioned in the house, it appeared that parliament had a different view of the duty of government , and mr windham agreed with him, but did not think it imperative on the house to take any steps in consequence but what was the feeling of the house lord sidmouth stated, that he did not think it his duty to make any communication and when further pressed he said, he did not conceive there was any necessary suspension of the regal functions the foundation of this statement was the assurance of the physicians, that his majesty was competent pitt, whose confidence in the existing government of that day, would not be suspected to be particularly marked, did on that occasion most successfully contend against the opinions of the gentlemen opposite he deprecated any unnecessary communication to parliament, because he considered that the practical result of such communication would be the unavoidable suspension of all public business then in progress in parliament he declared that the question ought to rest with the servants of the crown, and as they had the evidence of the physicians on the competence of his majesty, that they were bound to make the communication when they thought it necessary grey afterwards came down and urged the subject and lord sidmouth then stated, that his report of his majesty's competency was founded, not on his own observation, but on the opinions of the physicians grey, upon this, said no more, than that if this state of things continued much longer, he should bring the subject before the house in a more regular form would this have been enough if it had been thought that the silence of ministers was so criminal as the hon with no better evidence, now pronounced it to be with respect to what took place in 1801, he must contend that parliament must have been aware of the nature of the king's malady for lord sidmouth, whom it was in contemplation to appoint to the situations of and first lord of the treasury, vacated his scat on the 12th of february upon the children hundreds, and returned to that house again, and was thanked as a private individual it must have been, then, perfectly obvious that his majesty was indisposed, and there could have been no doubt as to the nature of his malady on the 27th of the month of february, in that year, whilethe bulletins were in existence, mr nicholis gave notice of a motion on the subject, which was received, however, with so much indignation, that it was got rid of without consulting the proposer such was the feeling of parliament on this subject, to which ministers naturally attended, in considering what was the line of their duty under such difficult circumstances he had already stated, that no act of government had been done at the time of the indisposition in 1804, till the 5th of march, when a bill passed relating to crown lands the chancellor wailed upon his majesty on the 4th and 5th it would be recollected that he was the highest officer under the crown, peculiarly competent to judge in a case of this kind, and sworn to give honest and faithful counsel the physicians were examined at that time, and told that it was intended to explain to his majesty, and to discuss with him the subjects of several bills then ready to receive the royal assent they said his majesty was perfectly capable of doing this the deliberate judgment of the chancellor after two conversations, the one on the 4th of march, the other on the 5th, was, that the king was perfectly competent on the 9th of march the royal assent was given by commission to several bills one of these was the mutiny bill now, if his majesty was thus competent, as upon the evidence of the physicians, as well as the judgment of the chancellor, they had every reason to believe, what would have been the situation of ministers if they had suffered the mutiny act to expire they might, indeed, have come to parliament for a remedy but the question was, whether, when such was the opinion of the physicians, they would not, by taking the executive authority out of the hands of the sovereign, have done an act tantamount to a dethronement of the king no unnecessary or unbecoming precaution characterised the administration but still though on the 22d and 27th of february the king was declared competent though the same opinion was given on the 4th and 5th of march, yet they did not proceed to act on it without first examining all the physicians before the cabinet and getting it medically confirmed then the commission and the sign manual were taken it was not true, as had been asserted by the hon , that the lord chancellor was the only person, up to the 23d of april, who had access to his majesty as the situation which he lord castlereagh then held was rather of a parliamentary character, he himself did not see the king but lord sid mouth had seen him on the 19th of march lord sidmouth, , had attended his majesty on the 19th of march, with official papers to be signed by the king, and thought his majesty fully competent to transact business, as the physicians had stated the next act was the commission for passing bills on the 23d of march at which day, dr heberden, taking his evidence altogether, had declared that his majesty was most fully competent on the 26th of march, a message had been brought to the house respecting the irish militia, the physicians having declared, that he was perfectly capable of holding communication with his parliament thus, after all those individual acts, his majesty came down at the close of the session, and made a speech from the throne these acts and this evidence would, he thought, go to shew that the privy council had not acted from a spirit of any illicit purpose, but from a clear and confirmed consciousness of public duty the principle of incapacitation to the extent contended for by the hon was perfectly monstrous on the face of it the hon seemed to think that when once his majesty's malady was established, though he might be declared capable of several acts, still he was not sane in his opinion, this was going too far his majesty's illness never had assumed that appearance of insanity it only amounted to a mental derangement it was very true, that he might not have been in full health, nov was any other person in recovery from a severe illness ever in full health but then he was not thereby totally incapacitated from a degree of fever, he might be subject to what the physicians denominated hurries but this could by no means be said to amount to a mental derangement this was the evidence of dr willis, who was particularly conversant in this species of disorder, and dr reynolds also spoke to the same effect the noble lord said, he had now laid the entire case before them, and he would submit to the house and the country, whether the government had not acted rightly, or, whether they had acted rashly without the consent and judgment of those medical men who might be best qualified to form an opinion on the subject before he sat down, he must deprecate singling out any particular minister as the object of accusation they were all equally responsible, and an hair of lord kidon's head should not be touched without himself suffering in an equal degree it would be presumptuous in him to say what line the house ought to take, or to what decision they should come but he had laid before them the materials on which to judge, and having so done, he should give, he hoped, a fair and dispassionate

1811,1811-02-25,the kinss illness in 1804,mr yorke,yorke,c p yorke,100,"notwithstanding the very able and convincing speech of the noble lord, felt it a duty to himself, implicated as he was by the charge of the hon up to the time of the change of lord sidmouth's administration, to say a few words on the subject in the first place, he entirely agreed with the noble lord, that the noble lord and himself, and all the confidential servants of the crown of that day, were equally responsible for the act charged by the hon as criminal for although it might be true that lord eldon, or lord sidmouth, by virtue of their office, might go to his majesty when the other members of the cabinet were excluded, yet the act alluded to was not done without a full communication with all the confidential servants of the crown, and without their unanimous concurrence as to its strict propriety the noble lord's account of the facts was perfectly accurate his own recollection had been aided by a reference to memoranda similar to those referred to by the noble lord, and he had no hesitation in saying, not only that the course adopted in 1804 was justifiable, but that, if it had been abstained from, the government would have proved them selves not only deeply criminal, but wholly unfit to retain their situations he had listened with the utmost attention to the hon who had made a distinct charge against lord eldon by name, and an indirect charge against all the other members of the cabinet in 1804, to hear what kind of a prima facie case he would make out and he confessed he was astonished to find, that at a distance of seven years from the transaction, the hon had not been able to adduce a single new fact he defied any one to say that there was a single circumstance stated by the hon which was not generally known in 1804 if, therefore, the hon was doing his duty in bringing forward this subject, he was at a loss to account why he should produce a charge at so great a distance of time in preference to the period in which it took place, and when it was recent in the memory of every man he thought that this being a charge to which a certain degree of criminality attached, after so long a period had been suffered to pass away, some facts should be produced, which would shew, or tend to shew, that certain circumstances of an underhand or suspicious nature had taken place, and through the interest and influence of his majesty's ministers had been acted upon why did not the hon bring forward this charge on the evidence of dr heberden, before the committee of the house of commons the reason seemed to be, because that physician's evidence on the cross examination produced many answers which were illustrative of his whole opinion, and explained the different periods between the 12th of february and the 25d of april, when his majesty was so far better, as to be capable of transacting business to a certain degree the hon had not, therefore, acted fairly or candidly, either by the house or by ministers, in giving the preference to dr heberden's examination before the house of lords the evidence taken before the committee of the house of commons, was what the hon should have referred to and what was that evidence when dr heberden was asked, what was the length of the period which he assigned for his majesty's recovery he replied, that he could not fix any precise limit, but that in his majesty's last illness, he had been called in on the 12th of february that his majesty's first presence in council was on the 23d of april following and that he expected his majesty's present case would follow nearly the same course why did not the hon refer to this evidence because dr heberden went on to explain, and to say, that although he limited the indisposition of his majesty within the two periods which he had mentioned, he by no means meant to infer that his majesty was during the whole of that time incompetent to business when asked, if he recollected the date of the last bulletin that he signed he replied in the negative but that at the time he signed it, his majesty was perfectly fit for business what was done had been done after the examination of the physicians, and with the general concurrence of the cabinet he insisted that the competence of his majesty was at that time the same as the competence of any individual whatever could be and the question was, whether, in such a state, an individual would not have been allowed to be perfectly competent to transact his own affairs he made a comparison of dates of the several bulletins, which shewed that his majesty was gradually recovering, and it was on a regular consultation, by the joint advice of all the physicians, that his majesty was declared capable of transacting business and, therefore, he knew that he was only acting conscientiously, when he, as one of his majesty's ministers, gave his advice in favour of the measures which were then pursued he was not in the habit of so often seeing his majesty at that time as some of the other ministers, but he perfectly well remembered having one interview with his majesty which lasted for a considerable time and he undertook to say that his majesty appeared perfectly competent to the transaction of public business that the state of his mind seemed perfectly correct and he would go further, and declare, that at that period his majesty appeared to him to be as fully competent to transact business, and to judge what was necessary for the service of the public, as many of those individuals whom the house saw and heard every day of their lives setting themselvesup as patterns of statesmen and legislators, and imagining that they possessed an exclusive patent for all the talents, all the virtues, and all the honours of the state",C,mp,none,uk.proc.d.1811-02-25.2.1.3,uk.proc.d.1811-02-25,1028,3,1,2,1810-11-01,4.5,15,NA,NA,0,0

whatever censure his sentiments might occur on the part of that right hon neither that, nor any other consideration should ever induce him to withhold them he had listened with attention to the very long and elaborate speech of the noble lord, from the whole of which he collected that all the noble lord wished was, to be put in a situation, in which he and his colleagues might have an opportunity of shewing their innocence it would, therefore, be natural for him and for the house to suppose, that the noble lord and his colleagues would be glad to adopt the motion of the hon which would afford them so fair an occasion of doing so instead of this, however, the noble lord and the right hon had retorted upon the hon who brought forward the motion, and made a charge against him for having suffered the accusation to have lain so long dormant this was a curious way of answering an argument it was in fact no answer the hon was not bound to bring it forward sooner, nor might it have been proper to have done so it was well known how, at particular periods of time, men in certain situations were so surrounded and clothed with power, that to bring forward a question of this nature would be altogether nugatory no space of time, however, should shelter men, who had official situations, and bad committed political crimes, from being called to account for their delinquencies but the fact was, that the circumstances which gave rise to this charge had not been long known and although it might be a long time since the transactions under consideration took place, yet it now appeared clearly, that ministers did, when the king was ill, transact business with him of that high and important nature, which they ought not to have done whatever might have been the former general notoriety of the transactions, it was a new fact, that in 1804 ministers had usurped the royal authority, and had dared to exercise the royal functions in his majesty's name, at the time that there were persons in the palace, under whose controul his majesty was placed he certainly would not say, that a slight bodily disorder, or any disorder but such a malady of the mind as incapacitated the monarch from performing the functions of his high office, should make it imperative to suspend the exercise of those functions but when the royal mind was alienated and rendered unable to apply to the objects before it, it became high treason for ministers to allow the king to go on in the apparent exercise of the royal power, and to procure his majesty's signature to instruments expressive of his will, when it was notorious that the king had neither power nor a will of his own in the statute book it was declared, that the keeping of the king from intercourse with his subjects that the keeping of him under guard and restraint, compelling him to act as those about him directed, was a crime of the highest nature there could be no doubt that the lord high chancellor stood foremost in the general culpability of the government the noble lord had, however, generously stepped forward to say, that he was equally responsible it was a convenient doctrine to maintain, that no one of a cabinet was responsible alone, but that all were responsible together for it was evidently not easy to punish a whole cabinet every great officer was responsible for the due execution of the duties belonging to his office and of all those great officers the lord chancellor was the most responsible, because in him was vested the greatest power and discretion let the noble lord be satisfied with the responsibility which he would be found to have incurred when some of his own former acts should come to be inquired into he would find that quite sufficient, without incurring a responsibility which did not particularly and especially bear upon him what had fallen from the noble lord was wholly irrelevant the simple fact was a fact which could not be contradicted, that the lord chancellor had put the greatseal to an act, purporting to be an act of the king, when such persons as were resorted to alone, when force became necessary for the controul of an individual, were about his majesty if this was not undermining the royal authority, what was it was telling the people, that the government could go on as well without the king as with him no man who thought that the kingly office, as established by law, was necessary to the integrity of the constitution, would allow the sceptre to be made a tool of in such hands with impunity he was persuaded that those who had been guilty of the acts, which he had described, had committed high crimes and misdemeanors against the constitution, and he should therefore heartily support the motion",LIB,mp,none,uk.proc.d.1811-02-25.2.1.4,uk.proc.d.1811-02-25,853,2,1,2,1810-11-01,4.5,16,NA,NA,0,0

at once to reply very briefly to what had been advanced and, in the first place, he contended, that not one of his assertions had been contradicted he had stated nothing but facts, and nothing of all he had asserted as facts had been attempted to be contradicted he had, indeed, waited for the attendance of the right hon bathurst, and it was most true that he had attended that he had, according to his own shewing heard the best defence that could be offered in behalf of his noble relative and though that defence did not attempt to question the truth of any one of the facts he had urged, yet the right hon had thought it prudent and discreet to give a silent vote upon such a question the case said is before the house i rest it upon a statement of facts, and that statement is not attempted to be controverted the alledged facts are not disputed by that noble lord, to whose speech, in the opinion of the right hon nothing can be added in behalf of the persons implicated to the noble lord, for his abundant personal civility, and still more for the very liberal credit he seems disposed to give to my motives, i have to return my thanks but if justice requires me to pay this tribute to the liberality and ingenuousness of the noble lord, it exacts from me a very marked distinction between the embarrassing kindness of the noble lord and the frank hostility of the right hon i certainly cannot charge him with too much liberality in construing my motives but i crave nothing considerate or favourable of the right hon he may continue to think of me as he pleases, while i shall endeavour to console myself under the consciousness of honest intentions with respect to the noble lord, i must again say, what i have said before so often, that really that noble lord is at times quite merciless in his kindness he meets apolitical antagonist in a way so polished and so gentlemanly as to disarm his adversary of the ordinary means of defence i confess the right hon yorke can not justly be made the subject of a similar charge he does not embarrass one with the mild civilities of his air and manner, he comes upon you, in his own direct way, which though perhaps not more conclusive than that of the noble lord, is certainly much more bouncing a laugh however, they had both agreed in one point, that as the hair of lord eldon's head ought not to be touched without subjecting their own hair to similar infliction, it was wisest and best to vote in the first instance, that there should be no inquiry at all the noble lord, indeed, had ridiculed the idea of ministerial influence regulating the conduct of parliament at that time no doubt it was a most extravagant notion, but the noble lord could not pretend to the influence of his right hon friend now in power i cannot pretend to say, observed , what that influence may be, but the right hon is fully competent to decide upon the growth and extent of it for it did happen, that in other times the right hon thought fifty too small a majority to keep him in power, but now ten or a dozen majority against ministers are too few to turn him out what had been said about pattern legislators, and so on, may be very pointed and good, when we come to find the application the gentleman meant, perhaps, to say something against somebody, but as i am utterly ignorant of what it may refer to, perhaps i should not err very widely in attributing it altogether to that bouncing manner to which i have before alluded, that sort of air that will attempt to make weak things strong, by speaking them in a strong way the mistake may not be peculiar to the right hon but i recollect when he was one of the ministers in 1804 his tone tonight reminded me of what he was then under certain circumstances of provocation and, indeed, those circumstances were rather irritating there was mr addington at the head of the government and really the poor man was much to be pitied night after night he had to answer mr fox, and to be answered by mr pitt need i say more what could the poor man do thus placed between two such grinding stones still, however, was the tone of the right hon yorke unsubdued, and he bounced about with as much energy and as much effect as he has done to night and it was of this government that the noble lord had said that mr pitt had not at that period distinguished it with peculiar marks of his confidence confidence really the noble lord has such an inverted mode of disguising things by words, that one would suppose the greatest possible favour which could be conferred on the noble lord would he actually kicking him out of office a laugh the noble lord had argued that if the government had not acted as it then did, they would have been the most miserable creatures but so were they charged by mr pitt to be he did not mince his meaning he thought them very miserable men men miserably deficient in the conduct of the affairs of this country, and men who consequently ought to be removed from the conduct of them this was mr pitt's opinion, and he acted upon it, for he left no effort untried till he succeeded in driving them from the helm but much has been said upon the presumed competency of the king at the time alluded to in the present charge against the lord chancellor, to transact business as well as any individual on the contrary, he would undertake to say, that any act of any individual under such circumstances would have been set aside he had been accused by the right hon of not doing his duty, in suffering this charge to have lain seven years dormant without bringing it forward but he would beg the house to recollect, that when lord eldon told the other house, in 1804, that the king was well, dr simmons was at that moment in attendance on the royal person the house, however, did not know it, nor had he the least idea of it the right hon had adverted to his conduct on various committees he had been on several committees with that right hon and generally found an opponent in him it was asked, why he did not crossexamine the physicians before the committee his answer was, why did not the noble lord and the right hon suffer him to do so why, when he attempted it, was he out voted he wished to do it, and tried to do it let him now only have an opportunity of crossexamining the physicians before the house or before a committee, and he would pledge himself to make out satisfactorily the whole of his charge the noble lord seemed to lay great stress on the evidence of dr heberden before that house he did not attach so much to it, for it was in some places rather contradictory, and no doctor could pronounce exactly upon every case but if any private gentleman had been under such circumstances as his majesty was in 1804, and that private gentleman had made his will, with doctors simmons and willis attending him at the time, that will would assuredly beset aside aye, and even by the same lord chancellor, baron eldon, if it were brought before him heberden then, it appeared, told the ministers they must be cautious how they touched on delicate points the noble lord had indeed said, that the country was at that time in danger of invasion, and, therefore, it was necessary that his majesty's ministers should not suffer the affairs of the stale to remain at a stand it appeared the king was well enough to talk of his private affairs, of the duke of york's estate bill, and of other matters of trivial moment but, touch on the affairs of his kingdom, and he was immediately thrown into a state of violent mental derangement the noble lord had talked of his majesty's disorder not being the same in 1801 and 1804 but to whom had his majesty been committed in both these cases to dr willis in the former year, and to dr simmons and his attendants in the latter the noble lord, however, had said, that every person in a cold or a fever must be under a certain degree of control he admitted they must, but it was not such a control as that of drs willis and simmons, and of their attendants the fact was, the king had not been treated with the tenderness he ought to have experienced he had been frequently brought forward in council, for the purpose of assenting to particular measures, which greatly affected and agitated his mind he had several times sat in council in the morning, and been in a state of strict coercion in the evening he had been taken from his family, and placed in other hands when, in the early part of the regency bill, he mr had asked, who had the custody of the king, the right hon , that when that affair was fairly before the house, he would answer the question that, however, he had not yet done he had been asked, as he before said, why he had not brought this forward before his answer was, that he did not know the king was under such control as it now appeared he was at that time to this the noble lord replied, would you have ail public business stopped would you have the mutiny act unpassed, and every thing run into confusion according to this doctrine, whenever the king was in a stage of mental derangement, though parliament be silting, ministers may refuse to make any provision for a similar misfortune, and perform all the acts of the executive government themselves because, say they, the king has responsible advisers, and afterwards these advisers come to the house, and use ail their influence to persuade it to vote against their responsibility the great question for the house then to decide, added , is, whether the king was not in the year 1804, at the period to which i allude, in such a state of mental infirmity, that if a private individual he could not have legally done any act affecting his property or personal rights it is contended on the other side, i know, that the king's competence to do any act of state was perfect on all those occasions, when he was called upon for the personal exercise of his royal functions but this i deny and i am willing to come to the test upon that single point how is this to be decided by the papers i call for you say that he was as competent as anyprivate individual, whose restoration had been legally recognized i challenge you to the proof of that i affirm, without fear of contradiction, that had the king at that period been tried as a private subject, the lord high chancellor, whom i now accuse, would have pronounced him incompetent for business the right hon may toss his head but this is all that he can do if he could have done more, we should have heard him as speak he must, for whom has he to speak with him it has been figuratively said, and truly i believe, that the blind, the halt and the lame, have been enlisted by the right hon in his service but it appears, that his choice took in the dumb also his right hon colleagues were dumb, from the old reason that they could say nothing upon any subject, and the right hon , only because it is a subject upon which nothing can be said for surely, if any thing could be said, that right hon could do it concluded with putting it to the house, that if the king should shortly recover and again unfortunately relapse, where were the provisions for the integrity of the executive power, if the conduct of the ministers in 1804 was to be sanctioned but if that conduct was thought unworthy of that sanction if it was not to be excused

oxfordshire militia before he entered into the merits of the case of this poor man, he wished to slate, that he had never seen him, nor had any communication whatever with him the officers composing the general courtmartial were wholly unknown to him, with the exception of the president, whom he knew merely by name at the same time, he must do justice to the character of the colonel of the oxfordshire militia colonel gore langton no man stood higher, both in a public and private point of view he was therefore bound to state, when he mentioned the name of the hon member as implicated in the complaint, that he must have been grossly deceived with respect to the conduct of corporal curtis this poor man was ill in the isle of wight, and wishing to see him upon the subject of his complaint, he mr wardle had gone down to portsmouth, but the wind blew so hard that he could not cross over to the island being obliged to return to town the next day, he left a friend there whom he desired to wait upon general taylor, and inform him, that he came at the desire of mr wardle to speak to robert curtis he saw the general, who peremptorily refused to let him have access to curtis, unless he had brought with him the authority of the commander in chief and the general added, that if even he mr wardle, had requested to see him, he should have given him a refusal in this state of things he had applied to the commander in chief, and se veral letters passed on the occasion the result was, that he found there was no chance of seeing curtis, unless he chose to give up the facts he had obtained respecting the proceedings having reasons for wishing to conceal those facts, which reasons he would now state to the house, he abstained from disclosing them to the commander in chief as a member of parliament he conceived that he had a right to visit curtis without assigning his motives however, be that as it might, the reasons which induced him to decline stating the facts to the commander in chief, were, that two of the witnesses had been forced out of the country the refusal of general taylor placed curtis in a worse situation than a condemned felon, for the latter had the liberty of seeing his friends the hon gent, then proceeded to state the case of curtis he was the son of respectable parents, but was induced, in the year 1808, to enter into the oxfordshire militia for a large bounty in 1810, he was a corporal in the regiment, and a clerk to the paymaster on the 23d of june, in the last year, he made complaints to his colonel of abuses in the regiment he complained, 1st, that an order for giving the men three pair of shoes in two years had not been executed and 2dly, he complained of the improper detention of pay from the men, under the pretence of stoppages on account of some articles of clothing or regimental breeches which had never been delivered these stoppages had been for five months, and the clothing was not given the stoppages for these five months had no other authority but the verbal order of the lieut he believed it was a thing almost unprecedented, that a whole regiment should be under stoppages for articles which government were to furnish at the end of eight months the only excuse for not giving the clothing was, that the men did not want them the 106th clause of the mutiny act expressly stated, that if any paymaster, agent or clerk, should unlawfully detain or withhold any pay due to the regiment for more than one month or if any officer, having received the pay, should retain it in his own hands, such officer, on being found guilty there of by a courtmartial, should, besides what other punishment the courtmartial should inflict, pay a penalty of 100 l to the informer, who, if a soldier, was also to be entitled to his discharge this clause was quite explicit, and did not leave the colonel or the general of the district any discretion upon the subject he had received an account of what had happened from a gentleman who was introduced to the general courtmartial, for the purpose of taking the depositions, and who was ready to verify the same at the bar of that house, or any where else it appeared from those depositions, that when corporal curtis first made his complaint, the colonel was excessively angry and threatened to try him for mutiny to which curtis replied, that as he came up alone to make his complaint, he could not be tried for mutiny on the 23d of june, he attended the colonel and lieutenantcolonel, and the book of orders being produced, he was called upon to shew the order with respect to the shoes or the breeches as he knew nothing of their books or the manner of keeping them, he was unable to do this on the 20th, he was confined for improper conduct in having been seen in brown clothes, at a mile distance from headquarters for this offence, he was by the sentence of a courtmartial reduced to the ranks it appeared, however, that he was the clerk to the paymaster, and in that capacity had been accustomed to wear coloured clothes as to his being a mile from the headquarters, he was returning from the postoffice, where he had just put in a letter to lord c somerset, the lieutenantgeneral commanding the district in this letter, he stated that he had a complaint to make against the quartermaster for improper detention of pay, and that he had stated it to his colonel, who refused to give him satisfaction he stated further, that he wished to take the advantage of the 106th clause of the mutiny act it appeared to him mr wardle that this statement was not improper, as the colonel had not given curtis the opportunity of proving his complaints before a courtmartial, as he was entitled to do this letter was sent by lord c somerset to the colonel of the regiment the colonel, in answer to it, said that he was not aware that any charges could be made out against the quartermaster and that as to the breeches, the men were aware that they were ready to be delivered, but that they did not then want them he also stated, that curtis came up to him in a very improper manner to make his complaint the fact, however, turned out to be, that the breeches were not ready for delivery at that time, nor even so late as july as to the impropriety of the manner in which curtis made his complaint, the colonel was walking on the drillground, when he came up and mentioned it to him in the case of governor wall, the lord chief justice was of opinion, that the man who died of the punishment he received in africa, had done no more than he had an undoubted right to do, in complaining to his officers of a detention of pay and it then appeared to the lord chief justice, that if a colonel was to check such complaints, it would have the appearance of his being a partaker in the plunder curtis had made his complaint regularly to his colonel and his general his colonel was applied to by him to try these charges by a general courtmartial instead of a regimental courtmartial, but he refused in a regimental courtmartial, it was well known that the officers were more connected with each other than they were in regular regiments, and this might produce a sort of bias no no from the ministerial bench that they were more connected was evident, and there was no accounting for feelings on such a subject a general courtmartial, on the other hand, was composed of men who were chiefly strangers to each other, and therefore it was a court which appeared more suitable for trying charges against an officer the prisoner was refused the usual intercourse with his witnesses and with his counsel, previous to the trial and even a great coat which he before had was taken from him, and he was obliged to lie on the bare boards two other privates, bellis and reeve, also gave a statement of other abuses, but the colonel said he would take care of them too they were brought before a courtmartial, and threw themselves on the mercy of the court they were sentenced to 500 lashes, which was remitted on their volunteering for foreign service it appeared that at the time of the trial of curtis, the quartermaster, serjeant fox, publicly threatened and endeavoured to intimidate the witnesses of corporal curtis and on the steps of the court publicly swore, that curtis was a d d rascal, and so was every one who took his part another serjeant publicly held out the expectation of twenty guineas and their discharge to any soldier that would prove that curtis had spoken disrespectfully of his colonel the charges were, first, for endeavouring to excite discontent and mutiny in the regiment of this charge he could not find a single tittle of evidence the next was that of his having spoke disrespectfully of his colonel it must, however, be allowed, that if he had spoken improperly of his colonel, his blind was under considerable irritation at the time he considered that he had been refused the satisfaction to which the military law entitled him he had conceived himself to be entitled to 100 l and his discharge for these charges he was sentenced to receive 1000 lashes the language, however, he had used concerning his commanding officer, was not a thousandth part as bad as what had been said of his commanding officer by a gallant admiral sir eliab harvey who had since been restored to the service he thought some similar allowance ought to be made in the present case it was in the recollection of all, that some german soldiers had been taken in the act of desertion, having stolen a boat for the purpose of going over to the enemy they were taken and tried but were they sentenced to be flogged no he believed they never did, nor never dared to put a lash on the backs of german soldiers and he saw no reason why british soldiers alone should be exposed to that severity it was on the 5th of august that curtis received his punishment he was at that time so sick and weak, that he was obliged to be supported while they tied him to the halberts during his punishment he fell into frequent fainting fits and having received 200 lashes, he got his election either to take the remaining 800 lashes, or to rot in the west indies he, of course, preferred the latter although he had only received a fifth of his punishment, he was confined from it in the hospital, from the 5th of august to the 14th of november the hon gent, then read a letter from curtis, written 12 days after the flogging, wherein he mentioned, that he would have been very glad if he had been able to bear the remaining 800 lashes, instead of being sent to the west indies, but the 200 had been administered with such extraordinary severity, that it was not possible for him to bear more his back was one complete sheet of corrupted matter, which drew from him all his strength, and made him almost unable to stand having stated thus much, he thought it was unnecessary to detain the house with many observations he trusted, that if the house would grant him a

1811,1811-02-26,motion respecting corporal curtis,mr manners sutton,m sutton,c m sutton,89,"judge advocate was of opinion, that unless the hon had made out a sufficient case, the house ought not to agree to the motion there were some passages in the hon gentleman's speech, in which the facts were so completely mistated, that he should be sorry to allow the question to go to a vote without commenting upon them, notwithstanding the strong impression which had evidently been made upon the house, by the observations of his hon friend who had just sat down he would therefore state shortly to the house the occurrences connected with the two courtsmartial, which the hon gent, was anxious to bring into discussion the transaction originated on the 23d of june, when curtis made to his colonel a complaint respecting two distinct articles shoes and breeches as to the case of shoes, he was persuaded that the hon mover had not made any inquiry into the subject, or else that he would have received better information it was clear, as his hon friend had said, that by the regulations each soldier was entitled to three pair of shoes in two years and as to the case of 1804, referred to by curtis, in which year the regiment did certainly receive two pair of shoes a man this was owing to the transfer of the supplementary militia into the regular militia the men being entitled to one pair as the supplementary, and to one pair as the regular it being found, however, that one pair was sufficient, a commutation took place, and each man was allowed five shillings, which went to pay for those necessaries which would otherwise have been provided for by stoppages the case of the breeches was as clear one pair was provided by government and the stoppage of 18 d a month was for the purpose of purchasing necessaries under which term an additional pair of breeches was included if this additional pair were found unnecessary, the stoppages were returned but the hon mover expressed his surprise that the stoppages took place before the breeches were wanted the reason of this was, that they were contrived to coincide with the period when long furloughs were granted, and when therefore it was easier for the men to make up their daily allowances than at a time when they were with the regiment whether this practice was judicious or not, he would not now stop to inquire but at least it was not liable to the imputation of severity or oppression he would further state, that in his opinion, when curtis quitted the colonel's room, he went away perfectly satisfied of his mistake with respect to the shoes, and satisfied also that an inquiry would be made as to the breeches what was the issue of that inquiry that curtis had antecedently gone to the paymaster, and obtained his own breeches that afterwards in ignorance of this circumstance, the whole had been drawn for, but that curtis's having before obtained his being found out a third pair was refused him curtis, however, wrote to the general of the district that the colonel did not chuse to redress him was this a true representation of the case this was on the 26th, and he had been with the colonel on the 25th he knew that it was possible that a person might forget, on the 26th of a month, having seen another on the 25th of the same month hear, hear he knew it was possible that a person might forget having had any conversation with another on the preceding day hear, hear but was it possible that this was the case with the man in question the court, who were the best judges, thought not the hon gent, however, controverted the court's decision he declared, that in his opinion the evidence was not sufficient to convict curtis on the particular charge preferred against him in this observation the hon seemed to forget the comparative disadvantage under which he laboured he collected his information from written evidence the court from parole evidence the court were on their oaths the hon gent, only dealt out most gratuitous assertions curtis was brought to a regimental courtmartial for wearing brown cloaths, and for being absent more than a mile from his quarters an offence which he committed on leaving the colonel's room on the 25th, the hon gent, could not have been so long in the army without knowing, that for such an offence the colonel of a regiment might reduce a noncommissioned officer to the ranks without any trial at all by a regimental courtmartial, however this man was tried, and by that courtmartial he was sentenced to be reduced to the ranks he then denied the jurisdiction of the court, and demanded to be tried by a general courtmartial it was worth considering that this demand of curtis's, or this appeal, as the hon gent, called it, was not an appeal which related in any way to the subject of clothing, but simply to the offence of having been absent from quarters subsequently to this period about the 4th of july charges were sent in to a general courtmartial, and curtis was brought before that court to be tried on them it was true, as stated by the hon gent, that curtis and that in a manner not at all decorous or respectful expressed to the general courtmartial a wish to be tried on his appeal from the judgment of the regimental court the general courtmartial, however, had not the power to try on any charges except on those upon which they were convened to determine when the hon gentleman was so inclined to throw out insinuations on all sides of him, it was fitting that the house should be informed, that not one of the members of the regimental courtmartial sat upon the general courtmartial if the hon gent, thought he had gained any credit in that house, or that he should gain any popularity in the country by intimating that the officers of the regimental courtmartial might be so influenced by regard for the feelings of their colonel as to perjure themselves on that account, he felt obliged to inform him that, at least, that intimation could not apply to the members of the general courtmartial the hon gent, had mentioned in a cursory way, and as a matter of little importance doubtlessly he would not have mentioned it at all, had he nut been aware that it would be stated by somebody, that he believed there was some little confusion in the course of the proceedings of that court the fact was, that owing to the crowd in the court, composed of persons whom the hon might perhaps term respectable, but whom he should call a mob the confusion and interruption were so great, that the acting deputy judge advocate wrote to him mr sutton to ask what means should be used to protect the court from insult the only answer that he could return was, that it was the duty of the court to take care that their proceedings were not interrupted and that if no other means were left them for the preservation of order, they must resort to force that they must commit any military man who should be so indiscreet as to contribute to the disturbance, and that they must send any other offending individual, not of the profession, before a magistrate, to be committed by that magistrate, and to be subsequently indicted by the judge advocate this was thetriflingcircumstance which flashed across the hon gentleman's mind, and which be casually mentioned with respect to the conduct of curtis, he was extremely sorry to say, that the man had not conducted himself as he ought, under the circumstances in which he was placed on not being permitted to put an improper question to a witness, he even went so far as to say, that he saw that he could get no justice in that court that he would appeal to a court of law and that he would bring an action against the lieutenantcolonel for false imprisonment and yet if the hon would refer to the first paragraph of the speech of curtis to the court for which he was indebted to the ability of the shorthand writer, he would find, that he entreated their pardon for the offence which he committed curtis was found guilty, and as for the consequent sentence of the court, he believed that few men he believed that no man, except the hon would state, that on conviction of such charges the punishment ought to be lenient the hon talked of the conduct of curtis as that of a man writhing under the sense of grievances, and contended that on that account he ought not to have been treated with severity but the house well knew the danger to the very existence of the army which lurked in any attempt to excite dissatistaction in a regiment, and would not allow that any individual, convicted of an offence of such magnitude, ought to escape on the plea of his writhing under the sense of grievances which were imaginary under such circumstances, when the court came to a conclusion that the man was guilty, they bad but one course to pursue not being charged with mutiny, the offence was not capital but the only species of punishment which the court was anthorised to inflict was corporeal punishment they had no alternative he would put it to the house to say, whether it was not for the court to admeasure the degree of punishment to the degree of gailt in his opinion the court had exercised a sound discretion in visiting with a heavy punishment such an offence, attended with so many circumstances of aggravation if the hon thought the punishment severe and unjustifiable, it must be because he thought that punishments of that description ought to be inflicted in no case if this were the real opinion of the hon he was persuaded that the house would agree with him, that the best mode of altering the law was not by stating in parliament and by consequence to the public a string, not of facts, but of garbled assertions, many of which were totally void of foundation he would now make a few observations on that part of the hon gentleman's speech which related to the communications which he had had with the commander in chief the hon applied to the commander in chief, for permission to send a person to curtis with some written questions mr wardle replied in the negative he should be sorry to misrepresent the hon , and therefore he would read the letter, which he happened to have in his pocket sutton here read a letter from mr wardle to sir david dundas, stating that, in consequence of circumstances which he had heard relative to the case of curtis, he went to portsmouth, for the purpose of going over to the isle of wight to see curtis, who was confined in the deephole there but that the badness of the weather prevented him from crossing, and that on the next day his parliamentary duty compelled him to return to town that on the following day a gentleman, at his request, went with written questions to curtis, c he trusted that the hon was convinced that he had not misrepresented him the answer of the commander in chief was, that he should be extremely obliged to the hon to state what the circumstances were to which he alluded, as it was the duty of the commander in chief to inquire into, and, if wrong, to redress them the hon , in reply, refused to state those circumstances declared that he would bring forward the subject in parliament, and frankly expressed his expectation that in the interval the commander in chief would receive from him, as a member of parliament, directions how to proceed the hon concluded one of his letters on this subject, by saying he was convinced that the course which he intended to pursue, would be beneficial to the military service he believed it was not usual in that house to express a doubt with respect to the goodness of the motives of any hon but if such were the motives of the hon mover, the deficiency of his judgment and the danger of his means were much to be lamented could the hon induce any one to believe could he induce even himself to believe, that the interests of the military service were likely to be promoted by encouraging those whose avowed and convicted object it was to endeavour to disseminate dissatisfaction in that service could the hon gent induce himself to believe that he was promoting the military service by throwing out loose charges against the officers of the regiment against the officers of a district against the commander in chief against all whose painful duty it was to execute the law if these were the hons sentiments, he did not envy him the house of commons had been accustomed to think that, excepting in very strong cases indeed, it was not their province to interfere with military matters but the hon assuming a sort of roving commission, proceeded without scruple to investigate the official duties of the commander in chief, and even went to the extent of using threats and intimidations to effect his purpose before he sat down he would say a few words respecting two men mentioned by the hon bellis and reeve the hon chose to declare that these persons were forced out of the country on account of the evidence they had given in curtis's favour the fact was, that when examined on that case, they produced written charges themselves and then the hon expressed his astonishment that the court did not proceed to an inquiry, which was out of the limits of their power, as for that inquiry they were not convened the colonel, however, inquired into the truth of these charges, and furthermore, a district courtmartial was held upon them the consequence of which was, that these two men were convicted of malicious intentions, and sentenced to receive 500 lashes each, a sentence which was afterwards commuted for foreign service and this was what the hon called forcing these persons out of the country on account of the evidence which they had given in the case of curtis with respect to the question which the court would not permit curtis to put, he had sufficient means of knowing what it was curtis wished to ask bellis whether some other man who had not been examined, nor was to be examined in the case, had not said something or other the court very properly declared that they could not permit such a question to be put, respecting a third person who had not been examined before them, and who was not to be examined that case, however, was afterwards inquired into a regimental courtmartial sat on the serjeant alluded to he was found guilty, and was reduced to the ranks if ever there was a case which, from the beginning to the end, would bear the closest sifting, it was that which the hon mover had selected for the purpose of proving the

setting forth, that the petitioners constitute a numerous and respectable class of the community, and the employment in which they are engaged being intimately connected with the interests of literature, and productive of many advantages to the state, has ever been considered as entitled to the protection and encouragement of the legislature and that the petitioners have of late felt themselves aggrieved in the exercise of their trade and business by the provisions of the act 39 geo 79, intituled,an act for the more effectual suppression of societies established for seditious and treasonable purposes, and for better preventing treasonable and seditious practicesand, as they humbly apprehend that the regulations which they beg leave to submit to the consideration of the house have been productive of hardships never meant to be imposed upon the petitioners, they are encouraged to hope that the grievance of which they complain will find a remedy in the wisdom and humanity of parliament and that the preamble to that part of the act in which the petitioners are principally concerned states,that whereas all persons printing and publishing any papers or writings are by law answerable for the contents thereof, but such responsibility hath of late been in a great degree eluded by the secret printing and publication of such seditious, immoral, and irreligious papers or writings as aforesaid, and it is therefore highly important to the public peace that it should in future be known by whom any such papers shall be printedand in section 27 it is enacted,that from and after the expiration of forty days after the passing of the said act, every person who shall print any paper or book whatsoever, which shall be meant or intended to be published or dispersed, whether the same shall be sold or given away, shall print upon the front of every such paper, if the same shall be printed on one side only, and upon the first and last leaves of every paper or book which shall consist of more than one leaf, in legible characters, his or her name, and the name of the city, town, parish, or place, and also the name, if any, of the square, street, lane, court, or place in which his or her dwelling house or usual place of abode shall be and every person who shall omit so to print his name and place of abode on every such paper or book printed by him, and also every person who shall publish or disperse, or assist in publishing or dispersing, either gratis or for money, any printed paper or book which shall have been printed after the expiration of forty days from the passing of this act, and on which the name and place of abode of the person printing the same shall not be printed as aforesaid, shall for every copy of such paper so published or dispersed by him forfeit and pay the sum of 20 l and that the petitioners, sensible of the policy of preventing the dissemination oftreasonable, irreligious, immoral,or libellous publications, submit, without repining, to a variety of regulations, by which their occupation is treated as of a character so suspicious, as to stand in need of preliminary securities for anticipated misbehaviour, and is subject to jealous and irksome restraints to which no other branch of useful and honest industry is condemned but though the petitioners have anxiously endeavoured to comply with the provisions of the law, they have found themselves exposed, by accidental mistake or trivial omission, to grievous and vexatious prosecutions, and to the danger of incurring pecuniary penalties to an enormous amount, without having been guilty of any thing offensive to morals, religion, or government that, by the aboverecited act, a penalty of 20 l is imposed for every copy of any book or paper printed without the name or place of abode of the printer being thereto affixed with the most minute precision and the petitioners humbly represent to the house, that the accidental violation of this part of the act, in the most inconsiderable circumstance, is attended with a severity of punishment which could not have been foreseen or intended it frequently happens that handbills for the discovery of stolen property, or other objects of a similar nature, must, for the public accommodation, be published within a few hours from the time the manuscript is given to the printers, and the copies may, in defiance of all ordinary precaution, issue from the press without containing the printer's name or place of abode, according to the literal direction of the act in such a case, penalties to the amount of 100,000 l may be incurred by a publication of the most innocent nature the number of copies of handbills, and other papers of that kind, usually printed, is from 250 to 5,000, and on every separate copy a penalty of 20 l attaches the printer may thus be exposed to utter ruin by the inadvertence of his servants during his temporay absence, or by their negligence or fraud, after he has taken every precaution to satisfy the provisions of the law in fact, printers have in various instances been harrassed by repeated prosecutions for different copies of the same publication the omission of the word london in the description of a printer's place of abode, in addition to that of a wellknown street in the metropolis, which precluded all sapposition of wilful disobedience of the law, has been deemed to be an offence under the statute, and has subjected the party charged to protracted prosecution and expence for transgressions of no higher malignity than this, the petitioners are liable to a severity of punishment which would be deemed adequate atonement for the most aggravated misdemeanor in several instances, persons have been entrapped into a violation of the law by common informers, and have been prosecuted under circumstances which implied no blame whatever the offences too, of which such may be the ruinous consequences, an withdrawn from the impartial and human cognizance of a jury, and decided upon summary proceedings before a single justice of the peace no appeal to the quarter sessions from the decision of the justice is allowed, the magistrate has not even the power of mitigating the penalty in the most favourable circumstances, nor will any number of convictions bar farther proceedings, while a single copy can be produced on which a penalty has not been awarded, and the common informer being exempted from the payment of costs in case of failure, is not deterred from repeating his vexatious attempts to obtain a conviction and that, as the petitioners are amenable to the laws for any seditious, immoral, irreligious, or libellous books or papers, which they may be guilty of printing and publishing, they submit with becoming humility to the house, that it is unnecessary to secure, by such excessive accumulation of penalties, a compliance with a regulation which, in case of an inoffensive paper, they can have no interest to omit, and of which the punishment is so disproportioned to the offence if the publication be of an illegal nature, or of a dangerous tendency, the printer is discovered when there is evidence to convict him of neglecting the regulation of the act, and he may be punished according to the degree of guilt which he has really incurred the house, indeed, cannot doubt that the provisions in question have been converted into an engine of vexation and oppression to the petitioners, without any benefit to the public, when they are informed, that, in every instance of prosecution, the publication on which the printer has been sued has been of an innocent or even useful nature in most cases, though the punishment may be so severe, an improper motive cannot even be imputed to the offender, there is no temptation to fraudulent evasion, and the occasions on which the printer is most likely to expose himself to exorbitant forfeitures, are those in which his vigilance is beguiled by the innocence of the matter contemplating disobedience to this act he would guard against detection, but in printing an harmless hand bill, he does not reflect that he may forfeit 100,000 l by the forget fulness of a moment all the chances of escape are reserved for deliberate violation of the law, and the utmost severity of forfeiture is incident to casual inadvertency and the petitioners beg leave further to submit to the house, that, while penalties and inconveniencies of such serious magnitude may be incurred without any intention to violate the law, and without any criminal negligence of conduct, persons of common prudence must be deterred from engaging in an occupation attended with such hazard the petitioners are the principal sufferers by the hardships, laid upon a business from which they expected to gain a reputable subsistence, and which it is too late for them to abandon, but the discouragement so severely felt by them, will ultimately prove injurious to the public at large, since it must tend to banish capital, ability, and reputation from a branch of industry by which numbers of persons are now honourably supported, from which no inconsiderable revenue is derived to the state, and which once was considered deserving of the peculiar favour of a free country the violation of the law against which it was the object of the legislature to guard, is most likely to be committed by men who have neither property nor character to forfeit, and it would probably be found that the security of the public from seditious, immoral, irreligious, or libellous publications, can be little promoted by the studied degradation of the press, and by compelling all men of spirit, integrity, and prudence, to seek other means of employment and praying the house to take the premises into consideration, and to grant them such relief as to the wisdom of the house shall seem meet the petition was ordered to lie upon the table and mr martin gave notice, that in consequence of the grievances there stated, he

1811,1811-03-04,army estimates,lord palmerstone,palmerstone,palmerston,95,"rose, in pursuance of his notice, to move the resolutions respecting the army estimates so perfectly aware was he of the difficulty of drawing the attention of the house to the dry and complicated details on this subject, that it was his intention to limit his observations as much as possible it was necessary, however, for him in the first place to point out to the committee, a circumstance, which any gentleman must have observed who had looked into the estimates, viz that though the estimates were framed in the same manner and upon the same principle as the estimates of last year, yet there were various alterations, which had been adopted with a view to render more intelligible the complicated details into which the estimates unavoidably extended the particular expenditure of ireland was contained in a separate column, and many articles of charge were placed under distinct heads, which were usually included in the army extraordinaries or cast into an aggregate mass he would now proceed to go through the various estimates in succession the first was that which related to his majesty's land forces in which the committee would perceive an increase of four hundred and seventy two men, and a decrease in the charge of 18,400 l this estimate was divided into several classes the first was the household troops the increase of the charge of which was 62 l this was a small sum, but as it proceeded from a circumstance which affected the charge of the whole of the regular troops, he would explain it it was well known to those who were conversant with regimental details, that it had been the custom to stop a part of the pay of the drummers or trumpeters of every regiment for the purpose of increasing the pay of the drummajors and trumpetmajors it had been ascertained, however, that this custom was not authorised by law it was therefore discontinued but as the pay of the drummajors and trumpetmajors was thereby reduced to an equality with that of the privates, it had been thought expedient to give them pay equal to that of serjeants, and this was effected throughout the whole army at an expence of between 3 and 4,000 l in the estimate of dragoon guards and dragoons, the charge would be found to have decreased 34,000 l this decrease arose chiefly from the transfer in ireland of the whole charge of forage to the commissariat department, and also as he had on a former occasion stated from the arrangement by which the charge of bread has also been transferred to that department the next class of the regular land forces was the infantry of the line in this there was an increase in number of 627, and in charge of 28,745 l this increase was attributable to the transfer from the foreign corps of the 97th regiment, formerly composed principally of foreigners, but lately recruited so entirely from the militia in this country as to have become a complete british regiment, and of the new brunswick fencibles raised originally in america and in the west indies, a provincial corps, but which had recently offered itself for general service the next class was the unnumbered corps it would be found to have decreased, in men, 352, in charge 8,600 l by the vote of last year it was resolved to reduce the waggon train, which had consisted of twelve troops, to seven three troops were immediately reduced, but the two others which were to be reduced, being in service with lord wellington, two of the home troops were sent out to replace them, in order that they might return for the purpose of reduction lord wellington, however, represented in such strong terms the advantage which he derived from the services of this corps, that the whole four troops were permitted to remain there were consequently six troops of the waggon train with lord wellington's army, one at cadiz, and two at home the estimate, therefore, for the waggon train had not decreased so much as was anticipated but the great decrease of charge on this general head of unnumbered corps, arose from the transfer of the north brunswick fencibles to the line, and from the total reduction of the manx fencibles in the miscellaneous charges, which stood next in order in the estimates, there was a decrease in the charge of 185,000 l which diminution arose from the difference, amounting to, 535,000 l between effective and noneffective pay of which difference 350,000 l might be applied to defray the pay, clothing, c of men expected to be raised in the present year the remainder constituted the decrease in this estimate, which he had already stated he now proceeded to the estimate of the troops serving in the east indies, the increase of which was 280,000 l for this no aid would be required, and the estimate was placed among the rest only to allow the committee to perceive at one view the whole military charges of the country, if that were to be defrayed by the public the item next in succession in the estimates was that for the regular embodied militia, and in this he had to observe that there was a decrease of 2,000 in the number of men, and an increase of 20,000 in the amount of charge when the estimates of last year were made up, the regiments of militia were incomplete, in consequence of the great reduction by the volunteering into the line three hundred thousand pounds had been deducted from the estimate last year on that account since that period the ballot had nearly filled the deficiencies up, and therefore in the present estimate only 155,000 l had been deducted on account of the pay and clothing of non effectives in the estimate of staff of garrisons, there was an increased charge of 600,000 l this arose from an increase on the irish staff of 37,000 l and from an increase on the foreign staff of 36,000 l counteracted by a decrease in the home staff of 16,000 l in the estimate of supernumerary officers, there was an increase of 2,000 l in the estimate of allowances to the principal officers of several public departments, there was an increase of 1,900 l in the estimate of halfpay and allowances to reduced officers there was an increase of 1,000 l arising from the allowances to quarter masters, and the half pay to officers of the garrison battalions the charge on the estimate of the inpensioners of chelsea and kilmainham hospitals was decreased 4,700 l in consequence of less money being necessary for the buildings that on the outpensioners appeared on the face of the estimates to be increased 93,000 l arising from the circumstance, that as last year 100,000 l out of 240,000 l recovered from the prize agents, was appropriated in aid of those establishments, this year only 25,000 l was so appropriated the real increase, therefore, of charge was only 18,000 l for england, and 5,000 l for ireland the noble lord then proceeded to notice the estimate for widow's pensions, in which there was an increase of 5,000 l in consequence of a correspondent addition to the number of individuals, who are the objects of this fund with respect to the volunteers, that extensive and important branch of the internal military organization of the country, gentlemen by looking into the estimates would find that there was a diminution to the amount of 303, 000 l a diminution which arose chiefly in england from a reduction in the on which the volunteers were to be called out on permanent duty the greater part of this reduction took place in ireland the actual diminution of charge in england amounted only to 35,000 l as he had before stated, by the reduction of the of duty the remainder of the reduction then arose in ireland, attributable in part to the same cause, but more particularly owing to the circumstance, that in that country the volunteers were not to be clothed this year on the race of the estimate of the local militia, there appeared an increase of charge of 61,000 l but this was attributable to the estimate of last year falling short of the expence by 128,000 l owing to the too small sum allowed for clothing to the augmentation of some of the corps and to the addition of others it was intended in the present year to reduce the number of training days from 21 to 14 and by this reduction a saving would be effected of 110,000 l when the state of efficiency, in which the local militia was reported to be by the district officers, was considered, it might be presumed that the service would not suffer by this arrangement the more especially as it was intended that those of the different corps which had not been out before, should be exercised for seven days previous to the regular training, under the permanent staff of their respective districts in the estimate of foreign corps there was a decrease of charge of 2,100 l in consequence of the incorporation of the 97th regiment into the line, and the total reduction of the regiment of malta the next estimate was that of the royal military college in the body of this estimate it would be found, that the charge was decreased 29,700 l a diminution arising from the supposition that no further sum would this year be required for the expence of building since the estimate had been framed, however, it had been signified to him that 30,000 l would be required to complete the building for the junior department one cause of an increase in a part of this estimate was the removal to woolwich of the cadets of the artillery, who used to contribute 100 l a year each to the establishment, and who were replaced by cadets, some of whom did not pay any thing, and none of whom contributed in an equal degree to their predecessors the estimate of the royal military asylum was nearly the same as last year that of retired chaplains was increased in charge 1,600 l the estimate of hospital expences was increased in charge 17,000 l 5,000 l for medicines, and the remainder for transfers made to that from other estimates the compassionate list and king's bounty estimate was increased in charge 7,600 l in consequence of the increase in the number of prisoners that were entitled to relief the estimate of the barrack department in ireland, was increased in charge 23,000 l a very large portion of which arose from the lodging and fuelmoney for recruiting parties from regiments on the british establishment the charge on the estimate of the irish commissariat would be found to have increased 73,000 l this was to be ascribed to the transfer to that department of the forage estimates on a general view of the whole of these estimates, it would appear, he observed, that there was a diminution in the number of men of 514 and that there was an increase in the charge of 42,000 l against this increase of charge, must be set, the saving which would arise from diminishing the on which the local militia were to be trained, which saving did not distinctly appear on the face of the estimates, and a balance would then be left of 60 of course he was aware that in such a variety of details there were many articles which he must have left unexplained he would reserve himself, however, for whatever inquiries might be made on the subject, to make any explanations which might be necessary having said thus mach, his lordship observed, that he would sit down without detaining the committee longer, were he not anxious to draw the attention of the committee to the state of our regular army, and to the view which government took of that subject this was a topic which obviously divided itself into two considerations first, the amount of the force necessary and secondly, the means by which that force should be kept up and rendered effectual to its purpose with respect to the first consideration, it was a matter of congratulation to the country, that parliament was not now called upon to devise the means of creating a regular army it was not as at the commencement of the war, when all we had to oppose to the invader, was the ardent and invincible, but undisciplined spirit of the people that time was gone by the country had now the satisfaction to see that they possessed a regular military establishment so powerful, as not only to enable us to lay our heads on our pillows in security, but also to arrest the progress of the enemy in those countries which he had already called his own hear hear hear the attention of parliament, therefore, must be directed, not to the means of augmenting the regular army, but to the means of keeping it effective and complete in order satisfactorily to pursue and perfect the investigation of this question, it became necessary to consider, first, what would be the probable amount of annual casualties, and secondly, from what sources the supply of those casualties could best and most effectually be provided the regular force of the country, exclusive of artillery, amounted to 235,000 men, of whom about 211,000 might be considered fully effective but considering the various, and some of them dangerous, services in which our army was unavoidably engaged, the casualties could not be assumed at less than 22 or 23,000 men for this number, therefore, it would be necessary to provide what were the means in the first place, the ordinary recruiting the produce of which, however, must be confined within certain limits for when the price of labour, which our extended agriculture, manufactures, and commerce occasioned was considered, it was not to be expected that many would anticipate, in the profession of a soldier, such paramount advantages as would induce them to quit the peaceful occupations of civil life he would state the probable produce of the ordinary recruiting, therefore, as low as 11,0 men it was true, that in the year 1810, the returns amounted only to between 9 and 10,000 men this was in a great measure to be attributed to the obstacles which the regular recruiting had to encounter last year from the ballot for the militia in the latter part of the year, and from the expectation of the ballot in the former part of it in some years the produce of the ordinary recruiting had been as high as 19,000 men but in the present state and circumstances of the country, he would not feel justified in calculating upon so large a result from the foreign recruiting, taking the average of the last two years, it was fair to expect 4 or 5,000 men, making with the regular recruiting altogether about 16,000 men, which, it was likely, would be obtained by voluntary inlistment to devise some mode of supplying the deficiency between that number and the number of casualties, was the province of government it had occurred to them, that it would be advisable to recur to the means which experience had shewn to be so successful, namely, to allow a certain portion of the militia to volunteer into the line the militia establishment was 92,000 men, of which the effectives might be considered to be 84,000, added to which there was due by ballot 5 or 6,000 men considering, on the one hand, the amount of the regular force which under any circumstance would be kept in this country, and on the other, the great security to the country arising from the local militia, which was every year increasing in discipline, it might be stated, without fear of contradiction, that the present establishment of the regular militia was greater than the national defence required it was proposed to reduce it to the old establishment, namely, 70,000 for the two islands and for this purpose to allow a number, not exceeding 10,000, to volunteer into the line tins measure was the less objectionable, as from the effective state of the militia, a new ballot would not be necessary until the end of the year 1812 his lordship expressed his persuasion that when parliament reflected on the number of men which had already been raised in this manner, they would be of opinion, with his majesty's government, that it was the best method which could be adopted to meet the casualties, and the least likely to interfere with the ordinary recruiting on the resumption of the house, it was his intention to move for leave to bring in a bill for this purpose if leave were granted him, he should, after it had been read a first time, move that it be printed, in order to give ample opportunity

estimates of the current year but, although they contain circumstances of great moment, i shall call the immediate attention of the committee to a subject, growing out of this branch of the public service, which i consider to be deserving of paramount and prior consideration i allude, sir, to the war now carried on by great britain, on a very extended scale, within the boundaries of the continent of europe on this occasion i do not arrogate to myself a superior degree of patriotism, or of military knowledge, but i discharge a conscientious duty to my country and, in the discharge of that duty, i will employ as much perspicuity and brevity as i can command it is my intention to attribute to his majesty's ministers full credit for patriotic designs, and virtuous motives that they conceive a war upon the continent will lessen the military power of buonaparté will protect our allies, the spaniards and the portuguese and will delay, or ultimately defeat, the invasion of the british isles on the contrary, i contend that such opinions, with our limited population, speaking comparatively of it with the population of europe, will offer up as unnecessary victims, the best soldiers of britain will not avail ultimately, in the defence of our allies, as the integrity of british resources can alone give us present security, and, in a more remote degree, afford a point and beacon of rally and redemption to the prostrate nations of europe and that the expenditure of our brave men, and our military resources upon the continent, will cooperate with the ambitious designs of buonaparté, and open a passage at an earlier period, and with more facility, to our mortal and inveterate enemy experience and common sense equally confirm the soundness and validity of these opinions if any nation undertakes a line of military operation beyond its means, or comparatively so with those of the enemy, the result must naturally produce a melancholy termination on the present occasion, i contend that our means are physically inadequate to the object in view, that the plan and system are founded in error and mistake, and must inevitably lead to disaster and destruction after this brief analysis of the argument between me and the gentleman opposite, i proceed to take a summary view of the two expeditions which have been sent by the ministers of the day, into the interior of spain, before i state the operations of the campaign which commenced in 1810 the papers and documents upon the tables of the two houses of parliament, clearly point out the rendezvous of the troops allotted to the command of lieut sir john moore, and hold out a delusive expectation, that the army under his command would have been able to penetrate to madrid, and render important service to the spanish cause we collect, likewise, from the papers in our possession, a description of the scanty state of the supplies to be expected by the british general, between salamanca and the capital a small division of this army was therefore intrusted to the command of lieut sir john hope, consisting principally of cavalry and artillery, who, by a circuitous march, reached the neighbourhood of madrid the vigilance of the commander, and the persevering activity of his officers and soldiers, extricated this detachment of the british army from a situation of imminent peril, as the french had occupied the pass of samosierra, and were extending themselves, in overbearing numbers, on the route of this small column i need not recapitulate to the committee all the disasters which pressed rapidly on sir john moore, owing to the erroneous intelligence which was conveyed to him from authority, and from the harrassing movements of superior bodies of the enemy it is sufficient for my present purpose to say, that sir john moore was compelled to offer battle, after hardships almost unparalleled, to an army which outnumbered his own, in the neighbourhood of corunna the committee will pardon me if i employ a few moments in giving a rapid sketch, yet faithful portrait, of this meritorious officer he, like his great example, general wolfe, had exercised his professional talents in the discipline of the troops which had been submitted to his command, and rendered them, by his attention, extremely skilful in every military movement he, too, like his illustrious prototype, after a series of mental as well as bodily fatigues, expired in the arms of victory posterity, however, in regretting the premature conclusion of such valuable lives, cannot fail to appreciate the marked difference which resulted from their deaths they both fought and conquered wolfe executed the plan of the earl of chatham, and a victory gave england possession of quebec and canada moore was employed by these ministers, and, although he evinced genius, intrepidity, and constancy, which he sealed with his blood, his army embarked with a heavy loss and great difficulty, and the french forces have ever since been banished from the northern provinces of spain the other instance of attack, on our part, was, as far as the papers laid upon our table justify us informing a judgment, principally planned, and personally conducted, by lord wellington his design seems to have been to form a junction with our allies, the spaniards and by the joint efforts of this force, to expel the french from madrid, and afterwards drive them beyond the river ebro the british forces employed upon this occasion were about 30,000, and well selected for any enterprise the spaniards, under general cuesta, and other leaders, were much more numerous, but not equal, either in officers or discipline, to the british the battle of talavera received the thanks of the imperial parliament, expressed by the respective organs of both houses, to the commander, the officers, and soldiers of the english army his majesty also marked the event, by conferring the distinction of a viscount upon sir arthur wellesley the history of the sequel to the battle of talavera, discovers that lord wellington left the principal part of his sick and wounded to the enemy, and, consigning his hospital to their humanity, by a rapid march to his rear, evaded the designs and power of marshals soult and mortier in crossing to the south bank of the tagus, our allies sustained a heavy loss of men from one of the french corps, and lord wellington sought security from the enemy, and cantonments for the british, on the unwholesome marshes of estremadura in this manner the second enterprise concluded, which was directed against the french, in the interior of the spanish territories the united army, not being able to penetrate to madrid, theallies separated in disgust, and the british commanderinchief returned to the neighbourhood of lisbon before i enter into a recital of the operations and the events of the campaign commenced in 1si0, it will be highly correct to make two observations i do not conceive the plan by the word plan, i mean the military outline of the defence of portugal to have originated with lord liverpool, who succeeded lord castlereagh in the war department of this country although the noble lord did express a desire of marching to paris in his earlier days, i do not think time has added to his chivalry, so much as to induce him to attack madrid, in the years of his maturity i therefore consider the suggestions with regard to offensive or defensive operations on the peninsula, to have proceeded principally from the judgment of lord wellington my second observation i confine to lord wellington entirely i beg leave to premise that the mention of that noble lord, which i am obliged to make in a narrative of this description, does not bear with it a criticism or an attack upon lord wellington's military conduct the time is not yet come, the documents are not yet arrived, to enable me or the house to form a complete judgment on the subject of the present campaign we are, unfortunately, only favoured with extracts of the noble lord's letters, from whence we cannot derive much information in short, the name of the commander in chief can no more be omitted, than the names of cato or hamlet, in the representations of those dramatic productions the campaign of 1810 opened by the approach of the contending armies, under the direction and command of lord wellington and marshal massena, to the frontier of spain the former had, according to the best accounts i could obtain, a british force, of artillery, cavalry, and infantry, nearly amounting to 34,000 men marshal beresford, who commanded the organized angloportuguese troops, had assembled about 20,000 of that nation, in the neighbourhood of lord wellington's army and this whole force was subject to the orders and control of the noble lord about the time of the appointment of marshal massena to the command of the army destined for the invasion of portugal, marshal ney was employed in collecting and preparing magazines of every description, to enable the french to undertake the siege of ciudad rodrigo the impediments to warfare, of every description, in the neighbourhood of salamanca, where depots were to be created, have been described in the papers placed on the table of this house sir john moore and the british army had experienced these difficulties, on their first arrival in spain, although the country had not at that period been impoverished by the troops of allies or enemies the season of the year, likewise, in addition to the other difficulties, seemed to oppose an insuperable barrier to the design of the enemy it cannot escape military notice, that the spring is more disadvantageous for the collection of subsistence titan the autumn, when the harvest is stored this was the precise time, however, when the enemy collected magazines for the siege of ciudad rodrigo, and it is quite evident that the country was compelled to supply the demands and wants of the french, with respect to subsistence, as the transport of heavy cannon and military stores would require all the horses and carriages, both spanish and french, within the grasp of the power of the latter, in order to advance so formidable an undertaking for the defence of this fortress, the spaniards made preparations, the works were inspected, the artillery placed upon the ramparts, and some select regiments of the spanish line composed the garrison, which was expected to resist the effort of the assailants, according to the report which we received from the lisbon gazettes, for a considerable time in the sort of narrative which i am now giving to the committee, which it is equally difficult and delicate for an english officer to attempt if i wish that narrative to be worthy of attention, i must describe the military events which present themselves, without any bias or partiality, and by adhering as closely to the line of truth as the present materials will allow me to discover it, give a faithful delineation of the facts as the obstacles which presented themselves to the enemy were of no common description, great expectations were created by the reports of the day, and the newspapers of this country, that the enemy would fail in the enterprise commenced for, in looking at the investiture of ciudad rodrigo, the local disadvantages, with regard to subsistence and the roads, were not the only impediments in the way of the french army lord wellington, with the allied forces, was posted in the neighbourhood of that fortress i cannot help remarking to the committee, at this moment, the fondness of the majority of the gentlemen opposite, of calling in, upon a variety of occasions, the assistance of great authorities we too have our military authorities and we regard the conduct of the duke of marlborough, of prince eugene, and of the king of prussia, in as high a point of value and consideration, as those hon gentlemen do the sayings of lord coke, judge holt, and mr justice blackstone the duke of marlborough and prince eugene considered the investiture of lisle as a difficult operation, after they had weakened the french power, and driven it from the field the first illustrious character commanded the army of observation, and prince eugene superintended the works directed against the place notwithstanding this combination of power and talent, lisle made a gallant defence, and, by a protracted fall, averted the evils which seemed to threaten france yet in the presence of the allied army, ciudad rodrigo did not make a long defence, and marshal massena pressed forwards to the portuguese frontier by a variety of channels of information, the people of england were made acquainted with the superior numbers of the french cavalry, and that the plains laying around ciudad rodrigo were unfavourable to the operations of an army, whose principal force consisted of infantry but it was represented that the rivers and the mountains, in the vicinity of almeida, presented a different scene of action, and more sanguine hopes of the failure of the french, in the attack of that place, were consequently entertained by the portuguese and the british nations it is natural to suppose that, previous to the attack of the enemy, the place was thoroughly inspected that the works were strengthened as much as possible, and that the best means were adopted to enable the garrison to make a long defence lord wellington undoubtedly had the option of defending the fortress, and the selection of the troops, for maintaining almeida, which some writers have staled to be the strongest and largest place on the frontier of portugal on the approach of the french, the rear guard of lord wellington fell back over the river coa, and almeida was invested i cannot help reminding the committee of the examinations which took place within these walls, with respect to the walcheren expedition, in the course of the last session of parliament that enterprise, it must be recollected, received the thanks of this house and, in the course of the proceedings to which i have alluded, it appeared that some officers, and some ministers, vaunted their own vigour, in being prepared to produce and open forty pieces of heavy cannon against antwerp, within the period of twenty days, in ease a landing had been effected upon the continent let us candidly survey the facilities and the difficulties which presented themselves to the british and the french on these two occasions the english possessed the most ample naval means that the history of the world can produce, to transport the apparatus necessary for any siege to the continent, and the contiguity of woolwich to the water is well known, and favourable to such a design the french had to struggle against every difficulty, arising from a tedious land carriage hostile and exasperated country bad roads and poverty of every description yet we discovered, i believe, in our own accounts of that transaction, that against the fortress of almeida, they opened their fire from 63 pieces of heavy ordnance, and that almeida surrendered after a defence of 48 hours if any person infers from this statement, that i depreciate the vigour, the talents, and the courage of the gallant officers and soldiers of my country, and raise those of our enemy into a state of superiority, i will give him a direct denial my examination of military records and my personal knowledge in the field, both enable me to approve the conclusion which proceeded from marshal villars, after a long experience and many severe conflicts against the british, that he would prefer the command of 2,5,000 national english, to 30,000 of any other nation in the world i only make these statements, as i am supported by facts, to prove the small degree of vigour in this vigorous administration, and the madness of our continental experiments with the account of the fall of almeida, strong insinuations of treachery against some officers of the garrison, and rumours of a conspiracy at lisbon, reached this country as to the particular points of the supposed infidelity, or of the magnitude of the conspiraey in the capital of portugal, we are not in possession of any documents to enable us to decide with propriety but the history of the world affords a general solution to similar reports under similar circumstances all historians have described the effects of invasion and overthrow, and have naturally and invariably shewn, that a people ceases to possess confidence when they cannot obtain protection the early and unexpected surrender of these fortresses, ciudad rodrigo and almeida, must have produced disagreeable sensations in the minds of our allies, and instantaneously occasioned those military movements which they had not anticipated it had been represented, both in lisbon and the camp, that the defence of two fortified places, well stored and garrisoned for a siege, and within the reach of one day's march of the allied army, would have augmented the enemy's difficulties so as to have occasioned a retreat, or that the protracted defence of those fortresses would have called in aid the periodical rains of the country to defeat the entire design of the french the stores found in the fallen citadals must necessarily have been of great utility to marshal massena, and the ground occupied by the enemy obliged lord wellington to retrograde with the allied army notwithstanding the evidence of our senses upon this occasion, the inhabitants of great britain were overpowered by the rhapsody contained in the ministerial journals, on every mention of lord wellington, by their selfimportant reasonings upon military subjects, and by their positive affirmation that he had not commenced a retreat the treasury of england, at this particular juncture, appeared to be the magazine of news, where invention framed the fable of the day, and credulity stood ready to receive it it would be superfluous to enumerate the different towns, villages, and mountains, that were occupied by the allies, or the rivers that were passed between the frontier of portugal and the neighbourhood of coimbra, which stands almost in view of i the atlantic ocean during this state of anxiety and expectation, the park and tower guns, and the gazette, proclaimed the victory of busaco the reports of that repulse of the french, which have hitherto reached this country, contain such scanty information, that the whole transaction, as a military transaction, except the repulse, appears enigmatical we know that the british and portuguese troops were formed in line on the ridge of busaco that the french army approached the valley, which lay contiguous to the position of the allies that two detachments climbed the rocks and commenced their attack upon two points that the assailants were repulsed with considerable loss and that marshal massena did not renew his attempts, but immediately made a movement, which crossed the front of the allies, and eventually turned their left flank from the position of busaco we likewise learned lord wellington descended with some degree of precipitation, with the intention of destroying or carrying away the stores deposited at coimbra the possession of that place was, however, of short duration, the allied army soon passed to the left bank of the mondego, and the french obtained some supplies which could not be removed or burned by the allies i will not make any delay in order to criticise the report made relative to the portuguese militia, and the expectation formed of their frustrating the movement of the enemy through sardao the mention of such expectation excites more than a common share of surprise can the warmest admirer of irregular troops conceive that a body of portuguese militia, after the events of the present campaign, could stop a french army, of considerable numbers, in full march to a great object with the permission of the committee, i will now communicate to the superior wisdom of the gentlemen who now hear me, my conjecture on the causes which led to the attack at busaco it appears, by a document proceeding from the regency of portugal, that some portuguese had espoused the french side of the question, and, by a price set upon the marquis of alorno's head, at this period, that he was particularly obnoxious in the american war, the british had partizans of the same description when life, fortune, and character are at stake, the opinions of men are naturally heated, and their sentiments should be adopted with great caution it occurs, therefore, to me, that the gallo portuguese persuaded the french general to try, at all risks, an attack upon the british and portuguese, when formed in one line they impressed him with a belief, that the portuguese battalions would not stand the french fire and attack, and that a chasm would be made in some part of the position of the allies from which state of confusion, a general, skilful in military movements, would derive the greatest advantages and happiest consequences such an event might present to marshal massena the golden opportunity of achieving a great victory, at a considerable distance from lisbon, and the shipping of the british the consideration of the scene of action, the mode of the attack, the manner of desisting from it, the movements made directly after the repulse, all confirm me in the belief of the suggestion i have deliberately entertained the motionless state of lord wellington's army, immediately subsequent to the defeat of the french columns, and the proclamation which marshal beresford gave to the world about this period, both likewise minister to my conviction on this subject the proclamation alluded to, cites all portuguese officers, then absent from their battalions, immediately to join their colours, or plainly tells them they shall be stigmatized as deserters this term of infamy, proves the enormity of the transgression, and the number of the delinquents such a circumstance of notoriety could not escape the knowledge of the enemy's spies, and the portuguese adherents to the cause of france, and united with the other causes which i have enumerated, might have had some weight in alluring marshal massena to make the experiment which i have described, as the attack of the allies upon the ridge at busaco, cannot otherwise be accounted for, and appears, without such a design, entirely unnecessary from the neighbourhood of coimbra, the two armies moved with all possible celerity the allies, to attain their strong position at torres vedras and the french, to bring lordwellington to action, previous to his arrival within his fortified camp it is reported, that marshal massena disencumbered his army of its baggage and heavy cannon, in order to effect the design he had in contemplation the allies, however, accomplished their plan, and the french derived no other satisfaction from their rapid march, than confining them to the line of the road, preventing them from exploring the country, and driving in the cattle and other valuable articles, with which that part of portugal abounded on the arrival of the allies at torres vedras, supplies, equipments, and british reinforcements, were found in aid of lordwellington, and the position of his army had been strengthened by superior skill, and unceasing labour marshal massena soon discovered the strong situation, andformidable preparation of his adversary, and did not long cherish the idea of making an impression upon them in the present condition of his troops, after the hardships they had suffered, and which were daily accumulating around them from deserters, who flocked into the camp of the allies in great numbers, the wants anddistresses of the french, with respect to shoes, spirits, equipments, and even of ammunition, were strongly rumoured and almost correctly ascertained the periodical rains which had begun to fall, soonobliged marshal massena to send a constiderable corps, under general loison, to look out for subsistence and cantonments in the neighbourhood of santarem and the river zezere lord wellington, in a dispatch, dated on the 30th of october, mentions the departure of general loison's detachment, and his supposed arrival on the banks of that river, at a point, about forty miles distant from the french position before torres vedras after marshal massena had faced the allies without choosing to make any attempt upon their lines for nearly the space of one month, in which situation his army had suffered under severe privation, had been exposed to great inclemency of climate, and had sustained diminution by desertion, he withdrew at nightfall with great silence, in order to possess the cantonments prepared under the superintendance of general loison as the pursuit made by lord wellington was not productive of any considerable advantage, it will be necessary to survey the condition and situation of the two armies at the time they respectively took up their positions in the vicinity of cartaxo and santarem at this period, the first opportunity was afforded to the contending parties to relax from the severity of military duties, which, with little intermission, had prevailed in both camps during a long and arduous struggle before i state the relative condition of the two armies, and the result of the past operations, i will again make an appeal to the candour of the committee if i have made any observations, with too much severity, on the shortness of the sieges of ciudad rodrigo and almeida on the precipitate retreat of lord wellington upon the magazine of coimbra on the superior advantages of the allies after their arrival at torres vedras and the completion of marshal massena's retreat to santarem i must defend myself by saying, that the information received upon those subjects is as yet incomplete, and unsatisfactory to the military reader the documents, to enable us to judge with fairness and impartiality, have not yet been presented to the house of commons, and therefore the hour of approbation or condemnation is not yet arrived lord wellington's explanations may be perfectly satisfactory both to professional critics and a generous nation the military parts of the question are not yet before the tribunal of the public but what must great britain think of the system which has been acted upon for the last three years by the ministers before us that system, if it had any plan, must have embraced the entire defence of the peninsula in the first instance at the commencement of the present campaign, it must have had for its object the protection of the kingdom of portugal it now upholds lisbon, and at some future day, a large proportion of the navy of england may be collected and employed to protect and receive the surviving combatant of the british army the numbers andposition of the british, the portuguese, and the spanish troops at cartaxo and chamusca, enabled the commander in chief to cover and extend his lines at torres vedras, and to carry on the works near almeida, for the defence of the port of lisbon within the confines of his power it is now incumbent upon me to describe the extent of the population he has to provide for, and the means for carrying so necessary a duty into execution the military portion of the three armies, will require at least 90,000 rations each day the population of the intermediate towns andvillages, as well as lisbon, must necessarily amount to 200,000 mouths, nearlydestitute of food and the other inhabitants of portugal, who had preceded the march of the allies, or joined them on their route, will perhapsexceed another 100,000 the provisions, therefore, to be issued daily, without taking into account the marines and seamen on shore, or afloat in thetagus, will form a gross amount of nearly 400,000 rations the stores, either of a public or private nature, in lisbon, cannot have been left, after so continued a warfare, in an abundant state the desolation which prevails in war, must long ago have exhausted every article of life between torres yedras and the capital the supplies, to sustain the efforts of the soldiers, and the existence of the inhabitants, must almost entirely depend upon watercarriage from foreign countries america, as long as it suits her commercial advantages, and does not contravene her politics, may bring her flour the coasts of africa can yet afford fresh meat and ireland and england will yield and transport salted pork and beef, as well as hay, port wine, and many other necessary articles, to the shores of the tagus forthe whole of which, the treasury of eng land must provide the means of payment and for the most considerable part of these supplies, bullion, or bills of exchange, at a great loss of money, must be furnished, the sums paid likewise to the transportoffice, for the general service of the army, cannot be omitted, as that expense will not be found unimportant, it having contributed more than any other to the termination of the american war on the total loss of the british army, since the commencement of the continental war, by the sword, sickness, climate, and casualties, it is out of my power to form an accurate calculation by returns only of the men sent to, and returned from portugal, can the exact loss be precisely ascertained but i think i may hazard a conjecture, that great britain, up to this time, will have sustained a diminution of her disposable force to the amount of more than 50,000 men another circumstance, which i have not hitherto mentioned, cannot be passed over when the bank made a communication to government, late in the last year, of the difficulties which would occur in sending more bullion out of england, it was suggested that specie to a great amount might be procured at cadiz, on its arrival from spanish america but the distractions which prevail beyond the atlantic, preclude the hope of much money being obtained from that quarter on marshal massena's arrival at santarem, the condition of his army became greatly ameliorated the convents, churches, and buildings of that place, afforded both shelter and convenience to many battalions that had hitherto been in a houseless state the favourable situation of the local, it being protected by the tagus, the swamps, and the mountains, gave a great relief to the severity of the duty which before had necessarily been imposed upon the french soldiers the cantonments which had been provided between the river zezere, torres novas, goligao, thomar, lryria, and the contiguous villages, received the whole of the troops, and at the same time covered the most fertile as well as the best cultivated parts of portugal the ground, therefore, on which the french army now stood, gave comparative abundance, to what it had experienced either on the outset or during the continuance of the campaign the herds and flocks were found upon the land the mills were placed in a state of activity and the late harvest and vintage had hitherto received in those quarters little or no diminution it appears, by different channels of intelligence, that occasional patroles are made by the french, for various military purposes, to the frontier of spain, across the river mondego, and to lamego, on the banks of the douro which have been sometimes interrupted by the peasantry and the militia of the country notwithstanding any interruption from this, or any other cause, portugal has been obliged to supply the great proportion of the subsistence required by marshal massena, and must continue to furnish all his demands, until the seasons allow the junction of reinforcements, and the consequent commencement of active operations if we now survey, with candour and truth, the result of the operations since the commencement of the campaign, we must admit that the enemy has gained possession of two important fortresses, with their artillery, garrisons, and stores that he has advanced over rivers, mountains, and an extensive country and that he now occupies a position which keeps the allied army in check, and at the same time enables him to feed his troops, build boats and pontoons, and concert his future designs at this period of apparent repose in portugal, it may not be improper to call the attention of the committee to a retrospect of the transactions which had occurred in spain the desultory warfare which had been attempted both in the south and north, by british officers, and with british resources, had not been crowned with success the condition as well as character of spain had undergone a considerable alteration, since the commencement of the struggle, for the dearest rights and privileges of humanity the defeat and captivity of general dupont, an officer of reputed celebrity, the glorious and patriotic defences of saragossa and gerona, had no parallel in the late events upon the peninsula the surrender of ciudad rodrigo, and the fall of tortosa, with the abundant garrison and stores which it contained, bore no resemblance to the chivalrous and magnanimous efforts displayed in the first effervescence of the resistance to buonaparte an epitome of the state of spain, during the last nine months, is not an unimportant feature in the argument i am now offering to the committee the map of the peninsula shews the pyrenees, the frontier of portugal, and the french position at santarem, in their progress from france, as buonaparté has no water carriage, his troops must perform considerable marches they must traverse spain, in all directions, with stores and ammunition and great and small detachments must necessarily have seven or eight hundred miles to pass over, in order to advance the main operations before torres vedras what, therefore, must we think of the patriotism of eleven millions of people, in permitting the hostile bands of their oppressor to penetrate through the heart of their country to overwhelm their allies, when such natural obstacles as mountains, rivers, and defiles, are in their occupation and possession especially when we recollect that three british armies, and weapons and clothing of all descriptions for 300,000 men, have been transported from britain for the defence and use of the inhabitants yet we have proofs, so degrading to patriotism, weekly and daily exhibited to our contemplation, in the junction of all the different columns which reinforce massena's army of the numbers and the arrival of the reinforcements from france, his majesty's ministers must have more accurate accounts than the public have in their possession the private communications from lord wellington must contain more intelligence upon that point, than the mutilated gazetteletters given to the world we have heard of drouet, gardanne, erlon, and other general officers, bringing up columns and divisions, and of the progress of marshal bessieres through the northern provinces of spain but any thing like a clear amount of force is, in no account, specified with any thing like official regularity the people of england may fairly infer, from the silence of his majesty's ministers, and the known ambition of the tyrant of europe, that the reinforcements arrived in portugal, or expected by the french in that quarter, will be commensurate to the important object committed by buonaparte to the arrangement, vigilance, and charge, of marshal massena the preparations made by his majesty's ministers for reinforcing lord wellington's army in portugal, embraced a wide and distant extent and, if we give any consideration or reference to the foreign services and colonies of great britain, consisted of a greater supply than her population can long continue to support from sicily, gibraltar, cadiz, nova scotia, and the mother country, reinforcements for the peninsula have been selected it has been reported that a detachment of some magnitude has been sent from sicily the future security of that island is thereby, i apprehend, placed in a state of hazard, as i cannot discover any depot of soldiers from which that possession can be supplied, when the french and neapolitans recommence their operations the continental papers point out the preparations for future attacks in that quarter and the return of the british general at this juncture, who has acquired professional glory in defence of the sicilian court and country, rather impresses me with an opinion that he has not contemplated the measure alluded to, with perfect satisfaction the state of the garrison of gibraltar, and the reputed importance of that fortress, did not permit a great diminution for the warfare upon the peninsula a detachment was, however, selected under the command of lord blayney but from cadiz the draft has been so great, that the besieging army has been left at liberty to move almost entirely to the river guadiana, to cooperate in the manœuvres and operations of marshal massena through merida, stores of every description for the service of the french army in portugal, have been conveyed under the direction of marshal mortier and the spanish army on the banks of the guadiana, in the town of olivenza, has received a blow from marshal soult, who is reported to have marched his troops from the lines before cadiz from nova scotia and halifax, and other british dependencies in that quarter of the world, all the troops have been brought which might have contributed to influence the decisions of the american congress, in the diplomatic controversies now subsisting with the united states what is the condition of ireland is not our sister kingdom stripped to nakedness, and, by the late circular letter of the government, goaded to despair i forbear to ask for returns of the regular force in that island, which would equally prove the insecurity of that country, and the imbecility of his majesty's ministers i believe it has been said, since the commencement of this session, that the numbers of men are as great as they ever were for the protection of that island but doubting, as i do, the validity of that assertion, of what is the force for the defence of ireland now composed i entertain a great respect both for the volunteers and militia of that country i have often seen and admired them but i pass over summarily this question, by giving an opinion to the committee, after the experience arising from a considerable command in that island, during the present and the last war, that ireland ought not to be left without 25,000 regulars, during the continuance of the vital struggle between great britain and buonaparte if, upon due consideration, i imbibed that opinion nearly six years ago, the changes made in the north of europe, since that period, rather augment than diminish my conviction with respect to the force necessary for the security of that important quarter of the empire within the precincts of this island, every thing has been gleaned of a military description, to advance the quixotism of ministers upon the continent from the infantry of the line almost every battalion has been selected that was fit for service of the cavalry, you have not sent the last draft, at least you have not embarked the eleventh regiment, because i suppose representations have arrived of the unfitness of the local, in the neighbourhood of lisbon, for the operations of light dragoons, and of the present straightened situation of the cavalry already in that country, on account of forage but from the guards, which have two brigades at this instant serving in portugal and cadiz, you have been compelled, by imperious necessity, to make a miserable selection in point of numbers the three regiments produced, according to the information of the public prints, a reinforcement for the army in portugal of 100 noncommissioned officers and privates all the brigades, regiments, battalions, corps, and even companies which could be collected, have been assembled, and sent to the peninsula the great majority of them have long been acting upon the continent, and the last division of the british reinforcements has, ere now, arrived on the shores of the tagus laying out of the question the hazard incurred in all the quarters from whence troops have been drawn, what have you achieved, or what can you accomplish from the frontiers of spain, the allied armies of england and portugal have fallen back to the neighbourhood of lisbon, and with the pressure of an expense which will soon prove intolerable, and, to defray which, you must make an increase of your tax upon income, you have collected all the distressed inhabitants of portugal to ask for daily bread at the hands of the british general whilst our common enemy, pleased with the measures of your insanity, in prosecuting a continental war, is congregating at his leisure a mighty force, and can add to its immensity and mightiness in the comparative proportion of ten combatants to one, he is not entangled by suffering inhabitants by the cries of humanity or by the importunities of famishing thousands he is not restricted in his operations, by any respect for laws, human or divine he does not call in vain for reinforcements nor has he drained to the dregs the military population of europe massena and his master are now bringing to a close the downfall of british resources, and, with fell and malignant joy, are already contemplating a mortal blow against the unprotected vilals of our empire and constitution in this advanced age of the world, and in the present state of society, few occurrences, or even difficulties, can present themselves, in aid of which we may not derive advantage from history you had the power of investigating the conduct of our ancestors hume says, the english never entered upon foreign wars, although much too much addicted to that unwise course of proceeding, except when a young king of genius, to lead the armies, presented himself to the nation when distraction prevailed amongst their enemies and great allies were ready to cooperate in their designs the condition of europe, and the fallen state of austria, might have exhibited to his majesty's ministers a salutary lesson with respect to the peninsula if ancient history is worthy of your consideration, look at the fate of carthage a commercial against a military nation if that government bad not destined the flower of its army for the invasion of italy, the overthrow and destruction in africa might have been retarded, or ultimately averted but it is in vain to cite instances from history to you, if you are not admonished by your own errors you ought to have remembered the first illplanned expedition from salamanca, committed to sir john moore you ought to have remembered the enterprise directed against madrid, under the auspices of lord wellington both these awful lessons are written in the blood of your best soldiers and yet you intemperately urge on your course of folly and rashness, and lay open the last disposable army of england to dangers of that extent and alarm, as such a precious stake ought not to be liable to, except upon our own shores, and

1811,1811-03-04,army estimates,lord castlereagh,castlereagh,castlereagh,100,"said, he should not feel it necessary to trouble the committee at any length upon the financial part of the estimates the outline of the intended services had been explained with great clearness by the noble lord palmerstone, and the votes proposed seemed to be regulated with all due attention to economy, consistent with the efficiency of the army upon its present high scale, in point of numbers the only estimate to which he was particularly desirous of alluding, was that which went to reduce the annual training of the local militia from 21 to 11days the share to be had in creating this force, the interest he personally felt in its wellbeing, and the conviction impressed on his mind, that the permanent security of the empire rested on its improvemen and conservation, made him very reluctantly acquiesce in any retrenchment which might have a tendency to impair the discipline, and consequently the efficiency of this great system of national defence but whilst he acknowledged his repugnance to the proposed change in a military point of view, he was ready to admit that there were grave considerations which operated the other way, arising from a due attention to public expence, and the general convenience of the men serving in this state of things, as a friend of the measure, he thought it best to submit to the change, as an experiment the local militia bad hitherto found in the country nothing but friends he thought it would be prudent in its advocates not to attempt to strain a string which so happily had been wound up to its present pitch if we had been obliged to relax in the number of training days, which originally appeared to him necessary, he had the consolation to observe the institution flourish in a degree far beyond his hopes, from the universal zeal and spirit with which the nation had carried it into execution all distinctions of party had been lost in the common effort to that patriotic spirit he was willing to trust for preserving and improving this force, even under the proposed modifications, satisfied that there was but one common feeling in parliament, and throughout the country, that the efficiency of this institution must be upheld, and that so long as it was effectually sustained, the security of the british empire was placed beyond the reach of danger",INDEPENDENT,mp,none,uk.proc.d.1811-03-04.7.1.5,uk.proc.d.1811-03-04,395,2,1,7,1810-11-01,4.5,65,NA,NA,0,0
1811,1811-03-04,army estimates,lord castlereagh,castlereagh,castlereagh,100,"then proceeded to notice the concluding part of the secretary at war's speech, which related to the recruiting of the army it was that branch of the subject on which he had come down, desirous of calling for that information which the noble lord had so fully imparted to the house to those conversant with army details, it must have been obvious, without reference to returns, that carrying on operations abroad on the scale we now did, the waste of the army, even from the common casualties incident to troops in the field, must very considerably exceed the resources of ordinary recruiting in looking to what it might be necessary to do, he was ready to acquiesce in the principle laid down by the noble lord, that adverting to the magnitude of the force which the country now happily possessed, the object to be aimed at was rather to keep up, than augment the present numbers of the army it having fallen to his lot officially to propose to parliament all the onerous measures which had taken place since the year 1805, for levying men, it was gratifying to him to find, that these efforts had achieved the great object to which they were progressively directed that the zeal and perseverance of the nation, in cheerfully submitting to these burthens, was rewarded by the powerful army which they now possessed, unexampled before in any period of our history, and which left to parliament the easier task of hereafter upholding what by past labours had alreadybeen created in illustration of which lord c referred to the effective strength of the army, as stated by the noble lord, viz regulars 211,000, militia 81,000 total rank and file, regulars and militia, 295,000, exclusive of 24,000 artillery comparing this with the state of the land forces in 1805, viz regulars 155,000, militia 90,000, artillery 11,000, the committee will see what has been the result of the measures adopted, namely, an increase, after covering the annual waste, of not less than 56,000 regulars, and 10,000 artillery such being the state of the army, and the annual casualties being estimated by the noble lord at 23,000 men, which exceeded, by about 7,000 men, the average of former periods it remained to be considered how this waste was to be covered taking the produce of ordinary recruiting at eleven thousand men, and the foreign recruiting at from 2 to 3,000, there remained a deficiency of 10,000 men to be annually provided the measure of procuring these men by an annual draft from the militia, as suggested by the noble lord, had his entire approbation it was extending to the british militia a principle which had long been acted upon in ireland with the greatest advantage, and, as far as he could judge as an officer of militia, without any material prejudice either to the discipline or efficiency of the regiments which had been subject to the operation of the draft the details of the increase would be matter of discussion when the noble lord introduced his bill he would only now throw out two points for his lordship's previous consideration the first was, the great discouragement which the present regulation, with respect to the provisions for militiamen's wives and families, opposed to volunteering into the line he was aware that there was considerable difficulty and some delicacy in applying a remedy to this evil but he wished it to be considered, as men entered into the line upon a variety of terms, differing in their nature and degree of encouragement, whether the allowance now enjoyed by the wife and family of a militiaman might not be continued to them, at the public expence, relieving of course the counties from the charge, in the case of the husband agreeing to transfer his services to the line, and whether this would not operate as the best species of bounty without this encouragement he was afraid the measure might not prove productive, to the full extent, with it, he was confident it would and if this indulgence, as an extraordinary effort for securing a supply of men, was confined to the men now actually serving in the militia, no inconvenience could arise to the ordinary recruiting, which might otherwise happen, if it were allowed to operate as a circuitous mode of enlisting into the line the second point to which he wished to direct the attention of ministers was, the system which he had introduced in the bill of 1809, of endeavouring to protect, as far as possible, the counties from the heavy inconvenience of a ballot, by enlisting men for the regular militia at a fixed bounty, inferior to that of the line, and that bounty, where the vacancy arose from transfers to the line, falling as a charge upon the public, and not upon the county, provided the county succeeded within a certain time in raising the men wished to see this principle persevered in he thought it an equitable one he understood in many counties, where due exertions had been used, it had proved successful in exonerating the counties and he was impressed with the wisdom as well as importance of connecting with the proposed measure every regulation that could tend to mitigate its pressure he was aware, from the present numbers of the militia, as compared with the intended establishment of 72,000 men for the united kingdom, that a demand upon the counties was not likely for some time to occur, but the interval he thought ought to be employed in their levying, without expence or inconvenience to the counties, the men which were to protect them, at the end of the second year, from the inconveniences of a ballot, for the successful accomplishment of which useful purpose, a new facility would be found in the permanent staff of the local militia, which might be employed in aid of recruiting parties from the militia regiments in raising men in the respective counties having stated his views with respect to the means best calculated to keep up the army, lord castlereagh proceeded to call the attention of the committee to an improvement in the military system of the empire, which he had always deemed of the highest importance, of which he never had for a moment lost sight, and which he had only been induced, when in government, to delay pressing upon the consideration of parliament, from the persuasion that its success might have been risked, bad it been prematurely brought forward, entangled with the many other arduous military measures, which had in latter years occupied the attention of the legislature when he spoke of the military system of the empire, which he trusted at last had assumed a permanent shape, he did not refer to any particular mode of levying men for military service much political contest had taken place on this subject, which in its nature did not appear to him capable of being reduced to any immutable principle, but must vary with the occasion, the state of the country at the time, the difficulty or facility of procuring men, and be number required but what he considered as more immediately constituting our military system, and on which the repeated judgment of parliament had been pronounced, was 1st, that we should possess a large regular army adequate to all the various extensive demands of this great empire abroad, whose best interests, in time of war, even when viewed on defensive principles, was found to consist in the active annoyance of the enemy 2dly, that we should possess a still more numerous force of local militia, assembled occasionally for purposes of training, but calculated from its numbers at once to protect the country from even the menace of in vasion and 3d ly, a considerable force of regular militia, ready to be called forth at the first commencement of hostilities, an advantage which he was persuaded no other description of force coula possess and competent, from their being constantly under arms in time of war, to occupy the garrisons and advanced positions of the empire in the absence of the regular army, and to afford that defensive cover, under which the local militia, should an invasion be attempted, would have to assemble in looking to this system as a whole, and in contemplating the adequacy of each branch at the present moment to its respective functions, it was impossible not at once to be struck with the imperfection attaching to the latter branch of the public force, namely, the regular militia, whose sphere of service is not coextensive with the general exigencies of the empire, but is broken, and localized, by those national distinctions which happily, in other respects, have ceased with the union the inconveniences of this defective organization, perhaps, have been the more slow in impressing themselves on our minds, from the laudable alacrity with which the militia of both countries have been ready at all moments of exigency to fly to each others's assistance but independent of the time lost in giving legal effect to such voluntary offers of service, and the serious objections that attach in principle to troops having to deliberate at any time upon the duties they are to perform there are many cases that may arise, and must arise where the power of making a distribution of the militia force, different from what the law at present permits, may be of the highest importance to the empire, and yet the necessity for it, not of that obvious and striking nature, which, like the exigency of rebellion or invasion, at once calls for the tender of the services required, it is obvious how much the power of stationing a corps of british militia in ireland might facilitate, at this moment, the reinforcement of the british army in portugal and if a period should hereafter arrive, when, instead of the disposable force of the empire being employed, as at present, in a quarter where it in fact covers ireland from attack, it should be engaged in operations on the side of holland, or the shores of the baltic how materially might not the defence of ireland depend on the power of making such a distribution, considering the means the enemy generally possess of assembling a force, and menacing ireland from the western ports of the continent the principle of a common militia for the empire, however obvious impolicy, must rest for its accomplishment on the growing sense of its importance when the militia system was extended to scotland in the year 1797, it was not at first thought prudent to hazard the measure, by extending the services of the scottish militia to england, and it was not till a subsequent year that the conditions of the service of the scottish regiment were assimilated to those of the english militia it is not to be wondered at, therefore, if the extension of the principle to ireland has not more immediately followed the union but the time lord c said he was convinced was arrived, at least so he was led to be of opinion, from the communications he had had with individuals of both services, when this great work might be accomplished, under proper regulations, with the general concurrence, both of the british and irish militia when he spoke of regulations, he did it from a conviction, that to render the measure acceptable it was necessary that the gentlemen serving in the militia should be clearly apprised beforehand what the nature and extent of the inconvenience was to which, from the consolidation of the militias, they might be exposed with this view, and from a persuasion that in any other supposible case than that of actual rebellion or invasion, it could only be deemed expedient to employ a proportion of each militia in the other country lord castlereagh said, he was desirous of recommending, that the proportion should be fixed, not to be exceeded except in the event of rebellion or invasion that the tour of duty to serve in the other island, should he taken by the regiments in rotation, and that no regiment should remain on such service beyond a time to be limited it had occurred to him to propose, that the number liable to be so employed at one time, should not exceed onefourth of the british, and onethird of the irish militia, which would furnish a transferable force of about 10,000 men of the former, and 8,000 of the latter and that the period of the service of each regiment, out of its own island, should not exceed, at the utmost, two years he was aware, that a protracted absence from the vicinity of their own counties, might prove inconvenient both to the concerns of the regiment and of the officers but when it was considered that the rotation of service in ireland would, to the english militia, come round only once in eight years, supposing the whole period to be one of uninterrupted war, and that leaves of absence are, at all times, liberally granted to militia officers, whose private affairs require this indulgence, be could not but feel sanguine, that the gentlemen interested would, for so great an object, cheerfully submit to this additional sacrifice it was not merely to the military advantages of the measure that he looked with an anxious solicitude for its accomplishment he was of opinion, that its moral effects upon the empire would operate not less beneficially he could assure the committee that his desire to see it accomplished, did not spring from the smallest distrust of the irish militia soldier in his own country it was not the language of management, but of sincerity, when he declared, that his confidence in them was as unbounded as in any other portion of the militia army he had seen them tried severely in the worst of times such times as he trusted would never again recur, and had always found them do their duty with exemplary zeal and fidelity it was from a wish to cultivate intercourse, and to abolish every trace of separation between the component parts of the same empire, that he pressed the measure he was desirous that the gentlemen of england, serving in the militia, should, by observation, inform themselves of the actual state of ireland, unfortunately too little known, and too often misrepresented that they should witness on the spot the generous and endearing qualities which distinguished the national character of ireland, and which the pestilent labours of the disaffected had not been able to extinguish he was also anxious that the irish militia should have an opportunity of mixing with their fellowsubjects on this side of the channel for, proud as he felt of the essential qualities of his countrymen, he was persuaded they would derive advantage from passing in the service of their country, into great britain, and there witnessing the happy state of society in which a people lived, who had long subjected themselves to industrious and moral habits, who looked up to the magistrate as their best protector, and to the law, which had made them what they are, for every future blessing such an intercourse could not fail to improve both, to unite them in sentiments of common interest, and to cement in the feelings of the people, the union which had for ever bound their fates together he was himself old enough to remember when the different provinces in ireland were so estranged from each other in habits, that the inhabitants of the north and of the south felt it a less separation from their homes to cross the atlantic, than to transfer their residence and industry to the other extremity of the island time had done something to remove this, but the institution of the militia had done more the constant intercourse, the intermarriages, the knowledge derived of the entire island by the interchange of the regiments between county and county, since the year 1793, had nearly obliterated these prejudices, and made the inhabitants of ireland one people might not similar effects be hoped for in the empire from similar causes, and to procure such happy results, what efforts ought we not to make to render them effectual nothing is wanting but a further exertion, under the sanction of the legislature, of that patriotic devotion which the militia officers have never failed to display, whenever they saw and were convinced that the public service demanded it in order to lay the foundation, it would be sufficient to provide, that all men hereafter entering into the british and irish militia, shall be attested to serve in the united kingdom to empower his majesty to receive voluntary offers from the respective regiments, of an extension of service, with a power in the crown to invite such offers, under such rules and regulations as to his majesty should seem fit such was the general outline of the measure, which, with the concurrence of his colleagues, had he remained in government, and with the goodwill of the gentlemen of the militia, he should have been desirous of proposing to parliament he had felt it his duty a an individual, deeply impressed with its importance, humbly to submit his ideas upon it to the committee, but without the presumption of supposing, that unaided by the intercourse of office, a plan of this nature could be properly digested it was not his purpose to offer any preposition to parliament on the subject such a measure could only originate with propriety, or with any prospect of success, in his majesty's council he had done what became him in committing it to their consideration, they alone could judge of the prudence of bringing it forward, and select the time and mode of carrying it into effect he felt persuaded the measure itself rested upon principles which would conciliate to it friends, and invite support he trusted it would, upon due reflection, recommend itself to the militia of both countries, and that they would aid the king's government in rendering to the empire this most important service",INDEPENDENT,mp,none,uk.proc.d.1811-03-04.7.1.6,uk.proc.d.1811-03-04,3003,2,1,7,1810-11-01,4.5,66,NA,NA,0,0

opportunity for going into the discussion of the character and merits of the late campaign, i should have offered myself to the attention of the house at a much earlier hour but, although what i still conceive to be the prevalent understanding on this subject, will operate to prevent me from going into any detail upon it, at the present moment, yet after what has fallen from the hon general opposite general tarleton in his last speech respecting the state of the war in the peninsula, i should consider it an abandonment of my duty, and should reproach myself for having acted an unworthy part, if i were to omit to state shortly the opinions which i entertain upon that most interesting and important question the share which i personally had in originating those measures which have committed this country in the peninsula against france, renders it necessary for me, as well in vindication of my own conduct, as in justice to the principles by which the present ministers have proved themselves to be still actuated in the maintenance of the contest, to express my unaltered approbation of the system which they have continued to pursue when ever the arduous contest shall have been decided, whether it terminate adversely or triumphantly for the allied arms, i cannot but consider myself as deeply implicated in the issue, and i the rather take this occasion of putting in my claim to answer to this house and to my country for the part i have had in this system of measures, while the result is yet unascertained because if that result shall be, as i trust it will be, honourable and successful, i should appear after the event, to be claiming a participation of the credit to be derived from success, without having fairly exposed myself to a share of the blame which may be attached to failure as to the general policy of maintaining the contest in the peninsula, it is, in my opinion, not only true courage but true wisdom in great britain to avail herself of all means and opportunities of encountering the enemy, which may defer to the last the occasion, if that occasion is to arrrive, at which, we shall have to fight the battle upon our own shores in this view, i must contend that the operations of the campaign, even if considered as merely respecting the war in the peninsula have been eminently advantageous the enemy has at least been kept in check and we have not only been gaining time, which, in a war of such a character as this, is no small gain of itself, time for the working of chance in our favour, but our military means and the military discipline and efficiency of our allies have been greatly augmented the period of our final and separate struggle is deferred and the probabilities of success in it, are multiplied in our favour this at least is the fruit of the campaign in drawing his picture of the operations, which have taken place from the commencement of the peninsula war to the present moment, the hon general thinks he has said every thing, when he has declared, that those operations commenced near madrid and have terminated in the environs of lisbon that lord wellington set out with a determination to defend spain ther undertook to protect portugal and is now contented with merely covering lisbon why, sir, even admitting this representation of the hon general to be correct which, however, i utterly deny, though for the sake of the argument i am, willing to admit it i still contend, upon the general principle which i have already laid down, that, whilst there was a possibility of defending spain in spain itself, it was the duty, the policy, the essential interest of great britain to make every practicable effort for that purpose that when untoward circumstances rendered it inexpedient to prosecute the contest in that country, great britain was bound to maintain it in portugal and, if even the vicissitudes of war should have reduced us to the mere possession of the city of lisbon itself and the strong positions in its environs, even there great britain is as much bound in honour as she is impelled by a just sense of her own interest, to make her stand never should we give up our hold of the peninsula, while we are able to continue the contest not with prospect of success alone, but without danger of absolute destruction to our army but i must not by any means be understood, sir, as giving into or adopting any part of the views taken by the hon general of the operations of the last campaign on the contrary i maintain, that the hon general's views are as clearly at variance with the facts as those facts are happily at variance with what that hon general and his friends thought proper arbitrarily to anticipate last year, of the probable success of our operations in the peninsula if indeed we were to draw a comparison between the present state of affairs, and such a one as, without due consideration and comparison of means and probabilities, we might conceive to be desirable, we must admit that much is wanting to bring the result up to the standard of our wishes we must admit that much remains to be done but we are not therefore to give up the contest as hopeless, or to abandon the cause to despair but we have a right to resort to another standard of comparison we have to compare the present state of the peninsular war with the insolent vaunts of the enemy and with the gloomy predictions of many amongst ourselves we have aright, in forming our estimate of the prospect before us, to compare the present state of things with what it was when the whole of the peninsula was in the power of the enemy when all its strong fortresses were occupied by french troops, when not a breath of resistance was any where to be heard when the eagles of france were planted, not only over the walk of madrid but upon the ramparts of lisbon this is the comparison, sir, which we are entitled to make and from this i am authorised to draw inferences far different from those of the hon as i never was party to those dismal anticipations, which we have too often been condemned to hear in this house as i knew the talents and skill of the british general as i was convinced of the valour and discipline of the british army and as i confidently anticipated the best effects from the instruction and example of english officers on the physical and moral qualities of a brave nation, i have all along looked to the contest in portugal with hope a hope qualified undoubtedly by a mixture of anxiety but wholly unalloyed by any thing like despair nor has the result disappointed my expectations if lord wellington has arrested, in its career of victory, that mighty military power, before whose overwhelming masses the greatest armies of the continent have crumbled into dust if he has seized the uplilted bolt of vengeance, which was readyto be hurled against the devoted toners of lisbon, has diverted it from its destination, and conducted it harmless into the earth if, protecting the kingdom committed to his defence against the destroyers of the independance of nations, he has stood as it were between the dead and the living, and stayed that deadly plague which had filled every other part of europe with havock and desolation if he has done this, and no more than this, i am not, i cannot,be disappointed at the result of the campaign to have saved portugal, and in saving portugal to have procured for spain another year of hope, another season for exertion, and therewith to have given to europe another chance of recovering from the effects of this furious tempest which so long has raged with unabating fury, and has laid prostrate every thing great and venerable amongst the nations of the world this is no slight success, hear hear hear this is no mean glory it is a result worthy all the expence, and effort, and anxiety, that it has cost us and, if it does not satisfy our desires it may well make us ashamed of our fears but if, because lord wellington has done no more than this, it be thought that he has neglected to take advantage of opportunities to follow up his successes, and to destroy the whole force of the enemy, there is perhaps no commander, on whose behalf an appeal could be more confidently made against such a charge, to the whole tenor of his professional career, and to the prominent features of his military character if he did not think it prudent to follow up his success against a repulsed but still a superior and unbroken enemy, if he did not think himself warranted to put the advantage, which he had gained, to the hazard of an unequal conflict, and to risk by a culpable temerity the fruits of what he had gloriously achieved, we may very fairly presume that in taking a course, not the most congenial to his nature, he has adapted his measures to the circumstances of the campaign and to the peculiar situation in which he found himself placed let him not now be blamed for prudence after having been so often rebuked for impetuosity but disagreeing, sir, as i do with the hon general in his views upon the subject of the campaign, there is no one point upon which i differ more widely from him than as to the probable effect and ultimate advantage of the system of measures by which the army of england is now, for the first time for many years, arrayed, against the troops of france in a continental campaign, and contending for mastery under the eyes of europe the advantage to our own troops from practice in warfare and from having had frequent opportunities of establishing beyond the possibility of doubt, what we always knew, but what the enemy constantly flattered themselves they could disprove by denying the physical and moral superiority of the british soldier the impression necessarily produced upon the french armies, by the palpable demonstration thus presented to the world of the groundlessness of their own vainglorious pretensions to the character of invincible these surely are effects which justify the principle of the policy from which they are derived, and which not only contribute to the immediate glory but tend to the ultimate safety of this country the hon general looks to an invasion to a struggle for our own existence on our own shores surely the british soldier, who has fought in the peninsula, will not be a less adequate defender of his country, and the frenchman who has met him there in battle, will not be a more forward and confident invader the altered tone of the enemy, in speaking of the events and prospects of the campaign, is to me the most decisive evidence of the merits and services of our army and might, i should think, satisfy the hon general tarleton himself, that if we are one day or other to have to encounter the enemy on british ground, the transactions in portugal may at least have contributed to defer that event, so much to be deprecated, to a later period than has hitherto usually been assigned for it he might be satisfied, i really think, that, if such a day is likely ever to arrive, it would not have been so good policy to lock up the whole of our military population at home in trembling expectation of the moment, when it was to be called into action by the arrival of the enemy on our coast, as to fit ourselves for that vital struggle, by a system of active and enterprising hostility enuring our soldiers to the duties and hardships of war interposing obstacles to the progress of the enemy while yet at a distance and combining with the sacred duty of affording assistance to other nations, the most effectual preparations for our own ultimate defence if we were to have the choice of any one spot in the whole world, where this system could be most advantageously carried into effect, the present theatre of the war is that which we might most prudently have chosen in the peninsula, for the first time since the french revolution, france is exhausted by the expences of the war instead of being enriched by its spoils we have the best authority for this fact we have buonaparte's own explicit admission of it in the peninsula france acts at the end, as it were, of a long lever through a line of communications, extended, hazardous, and constantly interrupted and requiring scarcely less than another army dispersed along that line to keep up the means of feeding and recruiting the army which is employed in the operations of the war to us the sea is open and the distance and difficulty of communication no more than the length and risk of the voyage, which is trifling in the extreme these are the physical and military advantages which would induceme to choose as the scene of operations between great britain and france, the present theatre of war, as by far the most advantageous for england but it is impossible to put moral considerations out of the question to forget the ties which bind us to the common cause of nations and which connect the defence of their rights and independence with the separate security of our own we cannot but feel to how great a degree that, which we are doing for others, adds to our confidence as to what we shall be able to do for ourselves i have said, that the tone of the enemy has been changed are not our own feelings at least equally altered let us recollect that period, at the commencement of the war, when we were in daily expectation of some attempt at invasion we were all indeed confident, that if the enemy came to attack us on our own shores, we should make a most glorious resistance, and ultimately repel any force which he should be able to bring against us but the expressions of this confidence we did not scruple to utter, as if they conveyed something of no ordinary spirit and vigour the wisest and the bravest among us were not ashamed to speak of resistance to invasion as splendid victory who is there among us now, that is contented with such language or who feels, that he does justice to the military character of his country, when he merely professes to believe, that an invasion of this country would terminate in the disgrace and discomfiture of the invaders is this the language which we now use or are these the topics with which we are now conversant are not our language, our sentiments, and our feelings, really and genuinely of a higher sort what shall they seek the lion in his den, and brave him there oh let it not be said and whence then is this great and decisive change in public opinion whence but from the war in the peninsula and is not this a revolution of the highest importance a vain and vapouring confidence springing out of no principle, founded on no practice, and accompanied by no proof and test of its soundness, is indeed far from being a splendid, a safe, or a commendable quality, but a confidence, which has grown up gradually in proportion to our efforts and our trials which is founded not in our feelings but in our experience not singly in our own estimation of ourselves, but in a comparison of ourselves with our enemy which augurs what we may do in our own defence from what we have achieved in the defence of our allies this confidence is one which may be blamelessly felt, and safely relied on it is a solid principle of strength, as well as a just ground of exultation and to have purchased this confidence in ourselves is an object for the attainment of which no sacrifice which has been made, and no burden which may be incurred, can justly be thought more than sufficient much, however, as i applaud, and as i partake of this confidence, i am not so blindly sanguine as to look forward to certain success and glory, without taking into my consideration the possibility of a reverse but when i contemplate that side of the picture, i do so with this consolation, that if ever there was a moment or a situation in which failure disgrace i will not say, for that is not possible to such an army and such a commander, but in which the failure of the object for which we contend would be comparatively less injurious to us, and defeat more calamitous to the enemy, it is in my opinion the present moment, and the actual situation of the campaign in portugal and this too, from moral no less, or even more, than from military considerations the ruler of france has now the eyes of all europe fixed upon him he has now no distant diversion to distract his councils, or draw off the attention of his subjects and of mankind from the one grand object to which he stands pledged and bound the establishment of his usurped dominion in the peninsula if he fail in this, his defeat must be most signal and decisive it admits of no palliation it is not to be retrieved or compensated by lesser triumphs, nor to be obliterated from memory by the achievement of new successes in other quarters of the world to be foiled in this great object, and to be foiled by great britain, would be to him the most disgraceful, and consequently the most dangerous defeat that he has ever experienced breaking the charm of his ascendancy, and shaking the foundation of his power to us it would be the most glorious triumph that the events of this tremendous war have ever yet brought within our reach the seal of our fidelity to our allies the consummation of our military character and the pledge of our national safety such is the character and importance of the contest which is now at issue what that issue may be, i do not pretend to anticipate it is in the hands of providence but standing at this moment upon that awful eminence, which divides the past from the future the past chequered with variety of fortune, the future overshadowed with a darkness impervious to human foresight, i am anxious to declare unequivocally, while the issue is yet undecided, that the course and the system by which the military fortunes of the country have been brought to this crisis, have my most cordial and unqualified approbation, hear

the slave trade he moved, that the resolution of the house of the 10th of june 1806, be read and the same was read as follows resolved, that this house, conceiving the african slave trade to be contrary to the principles of justice, humanity, and sound policy, will, with all practicable expedition, proceed to take effectual measures for abolishing the said trade, in such manner, and at such period, as may be deemed advisable he also moved, that the resolution of the house, of the 15th of june, in the last session of parliament, respecting the slave trade, be read and the same was read, as follows resolved, nem that this house has learnt, with great surprise and indignation, the attempts which have recently been made to evade the prohibitions of the act abolishing the african slave trade and that this house will, early in the next session of parliament, take into its consideration such measures as may tend effectually to prevent such daring violations of the law the resolutions being read, the hon and learned gent said that he now rose, in pursuance of the notice he had given, and of the resolutions which had just been read, to move for leave to bring in a bill for the more effectually preventing the dealing in slaves when he remembered the almost unanimous feeling of the house on this subject, when the resolution which had been last read was come to when he reflected on the triumph with which the exertions of his hon friend, the member for yorkshire, had ultimately been crowned in this glorious struggle, he was induced to believe that it would scarcely be necessary for him to do more than to state, that, notwithstanding the acts of the legislature, notwithstanding the more recent resolution of that house expressive of their determination to see that act strictly enforced, still it appeared that there were persons who, in despite of their authority, did deal in this horrid trade, and did contrive to evade the penalties which they had imposed for the purpose of preventing it he might appeal for the truth of this statement, , and to various other sources of information which had come to his hands, and which were also known to many other members of the house, and which could leave no doubt whatever that a considerable traffic was still carried on in the trade in question, by subjects of this country, resident in our colonies it would be better for him, however, instead of referring to the evidence generally, to notice one or two instances which had come to his own knowledge, and which must satisfy any man, that the trade was persisted in, not only in defiance of the acts of the 46th and 47th of the king, but even in defiance of the last resolution of the house in doing so, he should have a disagreeable task to perform and, as he should have to allude to persons against whom he had such evidence as would be sufficient to lead to their conviction, were they to be sued for penalties, or even to bring home to them a capital felony, had it pleased the legislature to make it an offence of that nature, while he made his statement with full confidence of the truth of what he stated, he should, on account of the heaviness of the charge, not mention the names of the parties, nor even allude to them in any pointed manner the trade was now carried on, not by vessels supposed to be employed in such a traffic, but in the more innocent one of trading in wood and ivory one ship, the neptune, belonging to persons who had formerly been large dealers in this trade, had lately been sent on a voyage for the purchase of wood and ivory after its return, however, two of the men, persons of excellent character, had stated that the captain also took on board thirteen slaves and two boys, who were carried to the isle of princes, belonging to portugal the captain, after this, bought a smaller vessel, and carried on a traffic between the african coast and some foreign possessions, which served him as an entrepot another vessel, named the george, but the name of the captain of which he should not mention, it had been confessed by the captain himself had sailed expressly on a slaving voyage the captain had been heard to express his anxiety to get safely out of the port from whence he was to clear, not doubting that if he did so, he should be sure of sailing without interruption three months ago one of our king's ships stopped a merchant vessel, of which suspicions were entertained, and on examination, the carpenter declared that he had been ordered to fit her out with bulkheads and boards, which are the neverfailing symptoms of a slavetrader on the 12th of december, after the house had expressed its indignation at the attempts to continue this trade, a king's ship fell in with a vessel which bore the name of the marquis romana, but which was in reality the prince william, an english vessel, the owners of which were well known, and on board of which vessel there were not fewer than 109 negroes there were others in the same situation, but which he should not mention he could not help, however, alluding to other two vessels, which passed by the names of the gallicia and palafox, it being pretended that they were spanish vessels it was made incontestibly evident, however, that they belonged to english owners resident in this country, and were in part manned with english these vessels were stopped on another ground, and were on the point of being released, when it appeared from the deposition of one of the masters, that they were the queen charlotte and mohawk that they were well known to be the property of english owners were under the superintendence of english supercargoes and that the name of one of the captains was george woodbine, which he had changed to that of giorgio mandesilva, for the sake of carrying on the deception not to trouble the house with more instances of this kind, he begged only to call their attention to some letters from colonel maxwell, and from the judge of the admiralty at sierra leone these proved, that though the traffic was greatly diminished, and bore no proportion to its former extent, yet that there still existed sufficient to render it highly worthy of the attention of parliament, and that it well became them to consider how they should best free themselves from what still remained of it the judge mentioned that since his arrival in march, 1809, no fewer than 1091 slaves had been brought for condemnation in his court he was, therefore, warranted in saying, though the trade was greatly diminished, that what remained of it was well worthy the attention of the house he was not disposed to state that many of the slaves so carried off were introduced into the british colonies but he did say that they were carried to st bartholomew's, and st croix, for the purpose of being sent from thence into other islands in the latter island, advertisements for the sale of such slaves were even exhibited publicly and in open day it was not necessary for him to accuse those interested in our west india possessions with violating the act of the legislature of this country, and the resolutions of the house it was sufficient if these slaves were carried to demarara, berbice, and the other newly conquered islands if necessary, on this point he could refer to a contest between the governor of demarara and the planters of beibice, where, in a memorial by the latter, signed with their own names, it appeared, that they not only continued to import negroes, but that they were even ignorant of any law to prevent them from doing so, or if they were aware of such a law, that they were not disposed to attend to it what these memorialists principally complained of, was the frequent seduction of their weakminded and new negroes gentlemen might suppose that this was before the expression of the feelings of that house on the subject but no such thing this was only in november, 1809, no less than four years after the resolution of the house, and two years and a half after the passing of the statute in defiance of these resolutions and of the statute, therefore, the house saw the importation of new negroes encouraged if such a trade was suffered to be carried on, it would be better to stiller it to proceed as formerly, so that the honest dealer, as well as the smuggler, might have the means of carrying it on it was unjust to the fair trader, that he should be excluded, while the unfair trader made a calculation of the chances in his favour, and was suffered to be in a better situation than before the trade was put a stop to the west indian himself must be anxious to cut down a trade in which he himself had no share if, again, the house looked to the shipowners, they had now little or no interest in such a traffic, having diverted their capital into another channel the trade was so much reduced, so far as they could be concerned, that a love of contraband alone could induce them to wish its continuance thus, it was only from one description of persons that the house could now look for opposition to the effectual abolition of this traffic and they were the persons who, so far from being objects of favour or compassion, were those who ought peculiarly to be struck at, being those who were now concerned in an attempt to continue this trade in defiance of the resolutions of the house, and of the acts of the legislature it was enough for him only to allude to this fact, to take from such persons any portion of the favour of the house one successful adventure, it appeared, was sufficient to cover three or four failures, and with such prospects of advantage, not having the benefit of insurance, adventurers of this kind finding it necessary to be their own insurers, saw their advantage in having three or four ships out at one time if the house only considered that such persons could not but be aware of the nature of the trade in which they were about to deal, they could hardly fail being satisfied that there was not a single object more appropriate for criminal legislation a person fitting out a vessel for this trade knew that he was to arrive on the coast of africa, and that in various ways he was to get into his possession a cargo of human beings that he was to sell them into a state of slavery, infinitely exceeding every other, and with circumstances too disgusting to be dwelt on it was impossible, that a person engaged in such a speculation could have his eyes shut to the evils he was about to inflict so that instead of being a malum prokibitum , it must be seen to be a malum in se without going further into the cruelties of the trade, without looking to the hardships of the middle passage, it was impossible for any man to shut his eyes against the horrors of such a traffic and, what then should be said to a person in this country sending his deputies abroad to inflict miseries and cruelties greater than any other that such would properly fall under the cognizance of the criminal law, it would not be necessary for him to adduce many instances to prove by an act in the reign of george 2, any waterman on the river, carrying above a certain number of passengers in his boat or wherry, if by any accident a life should be lost, was declared guilty of felony so even while the slave trade was tolerated, it was punishable to carry above a certain number, in proportion to the tonnage of the vessel, through the middle passage there were many other instances which he might mention it was declared to be felony, without benefit of clergy, to damage any public works to damage london bridge, fulham bridge, c to destroy any lock or sluice on a canal to destroy any turnpike house or gale, c and by the 48th of the king, it was declared to be felony to steal oysters, for which the persons offending were subject to transportation for 14 years, or to hard labour for three years the house would recollect that he was talking of that which was robbery, torture, murder, and they would not fail to punish such an offence with something at least equal to the punishment imposed for stealing an oyster it was said that the great bulk of this trade in slaves, was carried on by the americans and the spaniards it would appear, however, that both of those countries were putting down the traffic as we had done, and the message from the president to the congress of the united states, recommended the taking of further measures for the complete abolition of that trade the measure he proposed to introduce would have the effect of making the supercargoes liable, who would be struck at by the act and if foreign cruizers should endeavour to come into any of our settlements, they might be brought to trial, as a foreigner in this country trying to escape might be brought to

parliament, and in the court of chancery the hon gent, regretted that he should be compelled to resort to the painful necessity of calling the most serious attention of the house to the situation of appellants in the highest court of judicature in the kingdom, and to the cases of suitors in the high court of chancery he had thought that after the assurance which he received during the last session from the right hon , that something would be done to redress the grievances of which suitors complained, that he should have been spared the trouble of intruding himself again on the as yet, however, notwithstanding the promise given, nothing had been done at least no active measure had been taker it was true that a motion had been made in the house of lords, and a committee appointed to inquire into these cases here the speaker interrupted the hon by reminding him that he was not strictly in order in making references to the proceedings in the other house of parliament proceeded, and admitted that he was not in order, observing, however, that in alluding to those proceedings, he spoke of the house of lords as an appellant jurisdiction in the house of lords then a motion had been made the speaker again, to order, requested the hon would abstain from making allusions to those proceedings, because this house had no distinct knowledge of them then declared, that though a committee for investigating the state of appeals had, in another place, been appointed, yet he should not be deterred from offering to the house his opinions as to the line of duty which ought to be pursued when it was made known to the house that great abuses did exist, not from the conduct of the judges, for that he was happy to say was far above suspicion, but from the delay of justice occasioned by the vast number of suitors which came before the court, it surely would not be denied, that in appealing to the justice of this house to render to the subjects of the realm what they had the right of claiming, he did no more than an act of duty what he desired the house was, to appoint a committee to inquire into the state of appeals, by searching the lordsjournals meaning to follow that motion up by another which might be attended with advantageous effects to the suitors he trusted it would not be imputed to him that he came forward arrogantly with idle plans of innovation all he desired for the subject was justice, as my lord coke very constitutionally had said let the suitors in court be heard fully without denial, and have justice speedily without delay that was what he now asked to shew that some alteration in the mode of administering justice in the courts of equity was now requisite, he need only state the information which he had received this information, which might not be strictly correct, but which, however, would be gathered from the register's book in the court of chancery, stated that suits had been so long before that court, that many persons interested therein had died before the termination of them more than half of the property, the object of litigation, was consumed in carrying on the suit, and the survivors having no right to the property when the case was at length heard when, therefore, such grievances were proved to exist, it became the duty of the legislature to apply the remedy, and he called upon the house now so to do the public contributed enough for doing what actually was not done the exorbitant sums paid for fees on trials, evidently shewed that at least the public were entitled to have justice it might be said, that the second lord at the head of the court employed the whole of his time in giving his attention to the cases before him why, so he did, but was it possible for any man, however eminent his abilities or sedulous his attention however anxious to dispose of the business of his court, when it had increased so much, could he do what a judge had done 50 years before, when the number of the cases was nothing in comparison with the present time in former times, in cases of bankruptcy only, namely, in 1731, just before lord talbot was made lord chancellor, the commissions sued out in that year amounted to 160 they, notwithstanding the prosperity of the country about which so much had been vaunted by gentlemen opposite, in 1809 amounted to 1,100 and in the present year, as he was informed, to upwards of 2,400 besides this accumulation, there were those of wills, settlements, and a variety of other cases, which came under the cognizance of the court, to an amount four or five times greater than in lord hardwicke's time was it possible, then, for one judge to get through such an immensity of business with every respect for lord eldon, whom he had known for many years, it was in his opinion impossible, however desirous he might be of doing his duty to the public, to get through it in moving for the committee, he assured the house he meant nothing invidious to the noble lord he asked merely for justice for the public how were they to get redress in former times, in strict conformity with the letter of the constitution, our ancestors had wisely provided for that redress by appointing what was termed a committee of courts of justice it was established in order that the subject might have recourse to it for redress but even this committee was a thing unknown to the legislature now the oldest officers of the house had not the least recollection of the sitting of such a committee, therefore that mode of obtaining redress was now entirely done away in cases of appeal, in the highest court in the kingdom, tardy was the progress of justice there, for the reasons before stated he was informed that at this time there were 300 appeals waiting for hearing in the order and course in which they were set down the number of causes heard ill one year were not more than thirteen of course, unless some provision was made by the legislature for the disposing of them, 20 years would not be sufficient time for hearing them did not this circumstance call for a remedy for the evil it might be said, what hopes could he entertain of obtaining redress for the subject, when men of splendid talents and great abilities could not avert the evil complained of to this he would reply, that his duty told him something must be done and when he i recollected the promise made to him in may, since which a period of eight months had passed, and things remained in the same state, he could not but feel that it was necessary this house should at least appoint a committee of inquiry the great fatigue which the lord chancellor had undergone, both in the house of lords and the court of chancery, was such, that only one cause had been heard, and that was not decided with the assistance of the master of the rolls, the list of causes was so great, that more than one hundred were in arrear some of the cases which had been decided, from the very long time they were in court, involved much of hardship and distress to the parties concerned he would instance one the case of miles, in which a widow claimed under a testamentary bequest of her husband, and the question which arose out of that bequest was, whether it did not bar her dowry in the agitation of that question, a period of from 12 to h years had elapsed, in the course of which the widow was reduced to the utmost distress, and the decision was not yet known another case was that of children claiming under a will, and entitled to a marriage settlement another, was that of suitors claiming a beneficial interest in leases it had happened that before the decision of the suit the leases had expired, consequently the party interested was deprived of his right in other cases of tenantry for life, the tenant had died before the decision of the court these were some of the cases of hardship would it, then, be too much to ask for redress in addition to these grievances, he would state, from the list of cases in arrears which he had gathered from two books, published by a mr beck with and a mr grant, two cases of appeal, the one, that of an english writ of error the other, that of a scotch writ of error in the latter case, though the lords of session had made a decree in favour of the party, in 1805, yet he was served with a writ of error, and the business came before the house of lords, and remained as yet undecided the respondent, an ensign in the army, was in consequence, by by being kept out of his right, reduced to great distress, and but for the kindness of some friends, who knew his claim to be founded in justice, and procured for him an ensigncy, he must have been literally starving the other case was that of two ladies of the names of bacon and wren, entitled to property, but of which a person named clayton claimed three fourths this case was heard in a court of law in 1801, and they got a verdict in their favour clayton, however, put in his writ of error, and brought the subject before the house of lords there it had continued ever since the unfortunate ladies were at a very advanced period of life, and by this conduct of clayton debarred the enjoyment of their right not only for the present, but perhaps eventually the house, he was sure, would do something to remedy the evil, something to expedite the business, because if they did not, they would by their refusal be doing what my lord coke reprobated, denying of justice the hon did not mean to impute to any one person in the courts of equity any dereliction of duty on the contrary, from the highest to the lowest they most conscientiously discharged their duty the lord chancellor, with the most scrupulous attention to the interests of the public, selected the most respectable men to fill the offices but though the head of that court were the most upright and conscientious judge that ever sat there, yet it was possible that solicitors might not be the most active it was therefore the duty of the legislature to supply the deficiency, and appoint one or two more judges to dispose of the business he trusted that it could not be said, that in moving for a committee he was running a race with the house of lords no such thing all he wished was, that the house would, by the appointment of a committee, ascertain what number of appeals were really before the lords, which they might learn by inspecting the journals of that house that being done, he would next desire that the committee should ascertain what number of causes had been disposed of in the court of chancery in the last five years this was the object which he had in view, and it was not an answer to him to say that it had been made in another place fourteen days ago he did assure the house, that he never had a chancery suit, nor would he have one he would rather put up with the loss of 2 or 3,000 l than run the risk of a decision the hon then moved, that a committee be appointed to inspect the journals of the house of lords, to ascertain the number of appeals now before that house, and to report the same to this house the next motion which the hon had to make, he observed, was to ascertain the number of motions

motion shall succeed or not, it will at least produce the beneficial effect of giving the right hon member the opportunity of declaring the motives which actuated the irish government to have recourse to the measures recommended in his circular letter that letter is a most important document it is a mandate to the entire magistracy of ireland, desiring them, under certain suppositions, to arrest threefourths of the population of ireland what the circumstances were which called for this unexpected measure, and at the particular moment produced that decision of the irish government, which led to the promulgation of this letter, must be information most important to the state of the empire those circumstances are yet new to as there is nothing in the letter calculated to inform us of the necessity of its circulation it was notorious that the catholic committee had been sitting for months, nay for years, under the very eye of the irish government that it had declared its intention of adding to its numbers twentyfour days before this circular letter was issued i hold in my hand a newspaper of the 22d of january, which gives a statement of the proceedings of the catholic committee, and i am anxious to read that statement, as it is my wish to make no observation, or to put no questions which are not founded on vouchers incapable of contradiction the debate, of which this paper gives a statement, took place on the 19th of january, and it appears from it, that mr hay, the catholic secretary, read a number of letters which he had received from many of the counties in ireland, in which the names of the managers returned by those counties were inserted there is a particular remark made on the return of lord castleross for the county of kerry, because such an occurrence went to illustrate the unanimity prevailing amongst the catholic body this proceeding was circulated as publicly in dublin, as any advertisement published in any of the london newspapers, twentyfour days before the issue of this circular letter when it was published it appeared to entail silence upon those who, whatever were their privations, still fancied they possessed the privileges of complaint it is usual almost in all countries to allow that right to the unfortunate it is not usual in this country to deny to the subject the privilege of approaching with his petition, either branch of the legislature in this document the catholic committee is designated as an illegal meeting that meeting had, in the view of the irish government, continued its sitting of the statements given in this dublin newspaper, either the lord lieutenant, or his subordinate ministers, could not be ignorant i am therefore most anxious to know, why such committee was suffered to proceed unquestioned why this very measure of adding to their numbers so openly avowed, but which has since in this house, been made the justification of this circular letter, were allowed to go on, from the 1st of january, to the 12th of february following the administration did not, perhaps, think itself permanent there was at the time a notion of a change but surely if such fatal consequences as were attributed, were likely to arise from the proceedings of that committee, no administration could be actuated by such unmanly and selfish views as from such a consideration to avoid the necessary means of averting the evil, and thereby transmit the mischief as a legacy to their successors it was not, however, till the 12th of february, immediately after his royal highness the prince regent was placed at the head of the executive government, under fetters and limitations, that this latter was issued what made it incumbent that such a measure should take place the moment the right hon member touched the irish shores, this night we have the opportunity of hearing explained it could not surely proceed from any sinister design to involve the government of the prince regent in the odium and unpopularity which might be calculated to proceed from such a measure the house must be desirous to ascertain what the circumstances were which justified the lord lieutenant in not having had recourse to it before and what was the nature of the proceedings which justified the right hon member in issuing it, immediately on his arrival this law had never before been put in force in ireland and when it was actually necessary to act upon it, against the alleged proceedings of such a portion of its population, one should have supposed that the administration would have had recourse to the wisest, most judicious, and most efficient method of carrying it into operation the power of carrying acts of parliament into effect in this country is in the crown in ireland it is vested in the lord lieutenant, with the advice of the council if, then, it was found necessary to act upon this law, which had never before been acted upon, i am much surprised that a proclamation to that effect had not been previously issued by the lord lieutenant and privy council that would have been a fair, liberal, and parental course there would in such case be a great authority weighing on the minds of the people it would have had the sanction of the great law authorities in the state indeed, not to have applied to the privy council previous to the measure, shewed a want of common prudence, i had almost said, common justice this course not having been pursued, i wish to know whether the law officers in ireland were consulted whether the letter now on this table was laid before, and had the sanction of, the irish attorney and solicitor general because even if the necessity for putting this law in force was so urgent, so binding and imperative, as not to allow the delay of submitting it to the privy council, it at least, without any danger to the public safety, could be laid before these law authorities, with whom the lord lieutenant is in the habit of consulting on the execution of the laws the right hon member, in the circular letter, warns the sheriffs of counties, that it had been reported to the irish government that delegates were to be elected to an illegal meeting, calling itself the catholic committee upon what grounds is it that he has designated that body an unlawful assembly is it unlawful in its own nature if it be so, why has he suffered it to exist so long in the very seat of government thinking it unlawful, did he, however, conceive it more judicious to connive at it and if, though unlawful, he did connive at it, it is most important to the peace of the empire, and to the tranquillity of ireland, that we should know the circumstances which induced him all of a sudden to depart from his previous system, and to arrest this as sembly in the exercise of its functions this letter of the right hon secretary applies to the past, as well as to the future conduct of the catholics of ireland why was it not thought proper to notice that past conduct before the catholic committee have done no act since the 19th of january, no act before the 12th of february and all their proceedings before that time were acts of such public notoriety, that it is impossible they could have escaped the notice of the duke of richmond, who must be acquainted with the most ordinary transactions of the country yet all these acts were allowed, and unno ticed by the irish government, till the 12th of february, when the sheriffs of the different counties were directed to inform the magistrates within their bounds to arrest all those who should have voted for any delegation to the catholic committee why were the catholics not previously warned of this proceeding why was the affair allowed to go peaceably on, till it arrived at such maturity, and why is it now all of a sudden looked upon with such a degree of abhorrence the magistrates are ordered to arrest all such persons as may have been concerned in voting such delegates, and commit them at once on bail this is a proceeding rather extraordinary, certainly for a first act, that the first notice which magistrates should receive, was to advert directly not to the future but to the past that the government knew the existence of the catholic committee, was aware of the proceedings of the catholic committee, and yet never warned them to abstain from assembling was this lenity in the irish government was it moderation was it a regard to the peace and security, and welfare of so great a portion of the inhabitants of this empire why were they not first warned and cautioned before this extraordinary step, and told, you are doing what you are not permitted to do we warn you therefore to desist do not persist in a conduct which is prohibited by the laws, and by which you may incur the guilt of their violation but nothing like this was done from the 1st of january to the 12th of february no step was taken with any such view the right hon , on a former occasion, that the only circumstance mentioned in the dispatches of the irish government, as the occasion of the measure, was the letter of the secretary to the catholic committee and that he had a confidence, when the conduct of that government should come to be examined, it would be found to be correct it is therefore with the greatest pleasure that i see the right hon secretary in his place this night, that he may justify the confidence reposed in him by his right hon this letter contains instructions to arrest the persons therein described, and only to liberate them on bail let us look at the powers vested in them by the act of the 33d of the king in a section of that act it is enacted, that if any delegates of any description assemble in any meeting, or if any person vote at any such meeting, or by any means vote, such representatives or delegates, on their being convicted, shall be liable to be punished for a misdemeanor the act says, after conviction but here, in the first instance, before any notice, warning, or report was made to the catholics on the subject, the magistrates were ordered to commit all persons who had offended against the provisions of this act now, sir, it is remarkable that the offence in this section, of assisting at an election, or attending and voting, is, on the conviction of the person, to be punished but this act is in itself no breach of the peace, nor does it necessarily lead to any breach of the peace, but is merely an inchoate offence, unless the delegation actually takes place here, however, in the first instance, on account of the mere circumstance of voting, the magistrates are ordered to commit, unless bail is given i believe the general rule in law has always been, that a justice of the peace, unless he is particularly empowered by statute, cannot, in the first instance, hold a party to bail, when no offence against the peace has been committed for treason, felony, breach of the peace, and for other offences of a similar nature, he has a right to arrest but he has no such right in cases which are offences by possibility merely, unless empowered by statute the statute that creates the offence does not, by such creation of the offence, give a right to arrest why in our law is truth a justification for a libel, but no justification for indictment, because it has a tendency to a breach of the peace but till the indictment no man can be held to bail so in many other crimes there are in like manner no powers to commit in the case of conspiracy, for instance, and of that most dangerous crime to human society, the crime of perjury, no bail can be exacted till an indictment takes place for such crimes have merely a tendency in their operation to a breach of the peace, but are not such a breach in themselves, and consequently a justice of the peace has no power to commit but whatever may be said as to these, sure i am, that as to the offence of the persons mentioned in the right hons letter, the magistrates can have no more power to hold to bail than for the most innocent actions of their lives do but hear the instructions which are issued you are required to cause to be arrested, and to commit to prison unless bail shall be given, all persons within your jurisdiction, who shall be guilty of giving, or having given, or of publishing, or having published, or of causing or having caused to be given or published, any written or other notice of the election and appointment, in any manner, of such representative, delegate, or manager as aforesaid or of attending, voting, or acting, or of having attended, voted, or acted in any manner, in the choice or appointment of such representative, delegate or manager yet attendance, according to the act, does not constitute an offence against the act, but merely the circumstance of voting read the words of the act if any person shall attend and vote, or by any other means shall vote, c but by these directions the magistrates are ordered to cause all persons who may have attended at any meeting to be arrested though these persons may have attended for the most innocent purposes though they may have attended for the most meritorious purposes though they may have attended for the very purpose of dissuading such delegation and yet we see all these innocent, or meritorious persons are liable to be arrested and sent to prison, unless held to bail, which in an instance when an individual is struggling against the whole power of government, must be frequently impossible surely the law is in all conscience strict enough it was not necessary for the right hon to make another provision to its severity he will, therefore, excuse me, if i ask him whether the measure of the irish government was previously submitted to the crown lawyers in ireland the other facts connected with this measure are fully as extraordinary on the 12th of february the right hon gent, denounces this assembly as an unlawful assembly, and threatens to proceed against all persons guilty of so assembling and he sends two officers of the police to disperse the assembly, which he had thus denounced as unlawful here are these officers sent to a room in dublin where the catholic committee was sitting they asked the gentlemen present, if they were the catholic committee according to a story given in a periodical paper, in the interests of government, they answered,yesbut, according to another account, written by the catholic gentlemen, contradictory of the former statement, they said, no then said the magistrates, we are very glad we have not the smallest inclination to disturb you we are quite satisfied and so they walked off without taking any one measure against this catholic committee certainly, however threatening and exasperating was the nature of the right hons letter, his messengers were messengers of peace and calmness these messengers were not imbued by these terrible apprehensions of the committee, otherwise they never would have suffered them to escape their vigilance by merely saying to them, we are not that catholic committee which you are sent to disperse there is another very extaordinary circumstance which i should be glad to hear the right hon the noble lord who presided at the meeting, said to the magistrates, that he was sorry that the right hon secretary had not applied to him, as he could easily have explained the purpose of their meeting, and he was very sorry, that without asking any explanation, they should have been so sent the magistrates said that they would inform the secretary, and that they had no doubt but he would be very glad to receive such explanation then after, it seems, the secretary expressed himself extremely happy to see them when lo, these gentlemen tell the magistrates that they have nothing to tell the secretary, but if he have business with them they are willing to attend upon him what is most curious is this, that both parties should have seemed so desirous of meeting, and yet could never effect a meeting, and that the right hon should have been obliged to cross the channel without being able to accomplish it but there are still other circumstances in this case not less full of wonder this catholic committee, which was denounced on the 12th of february as unlawful, continued to sit, not only before the 12th of february but since the 12th of february and in all the newspapers may be read addresses in the name of the catholic committee, published in the very teeth of the magistrates is not all this very wonderful, that a government so famous for dispatch, that the right hon , so famous for his vigour, should still allow that unlawful assembly to do these things the right hon , that he could not account for all these things the right hon secretary could has government at last found out its fault has it found out that this unlawful assembly was not unlawful, not mischievous in its tendency, and harbour no unfavourable designs though they will not condescend to detail what came has induced the right hon gent, to resort to such acts of violence, or at least promptitude, they have been sufficient to induce that right hon gent, to leave ireland i do not mean by saying this to attribute any ill intentions to the government of ireland i attribute no intentions to that government, good or bad, because, i own, i cannot comprehend them i cannot comprehend how a government can put forth a proclamation against an unlawful assembly, threatening to have all its members arrested, and afterwards suffer that assembly to sit, and publish their proceedings in the same manner as before i certainly cannot comprehend these things, and therefore i attribute no intention, because that intention is incomprehensible and all that i can say is, that i am extremely impatient to finish my motion, that i may be enabled to hear from the right hon a solution of this enigma the proceeding which the irish government has taken, is one of the very greatest moment ireland, from various causes, unnecessary for me now to notice, is unfortunately sufficiently irritable already and it was by no means necessary for the strong hand of government to increase that irritation one would suppose that the government was not willing to increase that irritation but yet, if we are allowed to judge from the violent resolutions published in the different newspapers in dublin, this measure of the government has caused the sorest feelings in the body of catholics of ireland the right hon must admit this irritation, and as it is not necessary, it is not therefore my wish to enter into any details before the house it must be admitted that this precipitate proceeding has given great offence is the right hon , therefore, not called on to justify that proceeding, and why he attributed these ill purposes and motives to the catholics and is he not called on to state what are the reasons which may have so suddenly stopt the accomplishment of these evil purposes i confess i cannot see how the right hon gent, can get out of this difficulty why, when the government had forborne so long, did they at last interfere why, when orders were issued, were those orders never enforced and why are the catholic assemblies still allowed to continue i wish to know if the chancellor, the judges, and the law officers who are members of the council, and whose authority is deservedly high in the coun try, were consulted i wish to know what accounts were transmitted to this country by the lord lieutenant, whose duty it is to know all these things, touching the dangers existing in ireland these are things of the utmost moment to ireland, and of the utmost moment to the whole empire and i will not allow the right hon gent, to let these subjects go without investigation i therefore, sir, move you, that an humble address be presented to his royal highness the prince regent, requesting that his royal highness will order to be laid before this house, a copy or copies of any proclamation or

1811,1811-03-07,catholics of ireland,mr ponsonby,ponsonby,g ponsonby,89,"said, sir in rising to claim the indulgence of the house in making my reply, i cannot help taking notice, in the first place, of the observations of the hon baronet who has just sat down i am sure that he has only stated his real sentiments on the subject, and that those sentiments are always entitled to consideration and respect but when he states that in his opinion the measure of catholic emancipation would not yield satisfaction to the people of ireland, it ought not to be forgotten that this was the mere opinion of an individual in opposition to the plain declarations, the known sentiments, and the expressed wishes, of the sufferers themselves surely the hon baronet will not be disposed to assume that he is better informed of the feelings and temper of the irish catholics than the catholics themselves, who have so long and so vainly supplicated for this boon of emancipation he can scarcely affect to know what will conciliate the complainants better than themselves the hon baronet remarked likewise that emancipation would be useless, unless accompanied by other measures upon what principle of justice, i will ask him, or by what rule of reasoning, can he determine to refuse the catholics one concession, only because he cannot at the same time yield them others why would he, because he cannot bestow on them what they do not ask, withhold that fur which they have so frequently petitioned an hon member delivered a panegyric upon the indulgence and lenity which had uniformly characterised the duke of richmond's government sir, i shall be the last man in any place, or on any occasion, whatever may be my political enmities, to impute to any man misconduct, where there is not evidence of his culpability in the panegyric, therefore, on his grace the lord lieutenant, i am folly inclined to concur, as far as it may be understood to imply that good humour and benevolent intention by which i believe him to have been actuated but this is not the question now before the house, and has no connection with the distinct consideration of the merits and demerits of a proceeding so contrary to the general character of the irish government, and so opposite to the qualities that formed the ground of the panegyrics which we have heard the right hon secretary has accused the catholic committee of departing from their former views, and of adopting principles different from those which they originally assembled to promote but he has been utterly unable to name the period at which this alteration commenced, or the time their new purposes have been entertained ah is conjecture vague and unsupported statement in proof, however, of his assertion, the right hon gent, has told us that some violent speeches were made at the meetings of the committee are we then, because some individual, perhaps more warmly than is prudent, inveighs against the authors of a particular grievance, to condemn to silence all those who may assemble to take it into quiet consideration is the indiscretion of one man to involve in its consequences the interest of thousands what should we think of his candour who, because he had heard a talkative, impertinent person engross to himself the privilege of speaking, should set down ail the rest of the company to be fools among the speeches alluded to by the right hon gent, is that of mr finnerty, who is now confined in lincoln gaol for a libel on lord castlereagh i certainly cannot claim any acquaintance with mr finnerty, and it strikes me very forcibly that the introduction of that gentleman's name on this occasion was an expedient of the right hon , intended to serve a special purpose now, sir, as to the speech itself of mr finnerty, i cannot, i confess, see any thing in it which is not equally creditable to himself and to the committee, to whom it was addressed for what is its drift and argument he, an irishman, lately arrived from england, finds the irish catholics in a state of discontent and irritation, ascribing their grievances to english connection, and he tells them that they are deceived that the english people are not deaf to their complaints that they are not insensible of their sufferings and their wrongs but that these ought to be attributed to the government of england, and to the government alone he exhorts them not to despair, not to desert their appeal to parliament, and urges them to a steady and unremitting perseverance in the course on which they had already entered these, prudent and welltimed suggestions were, prudently adopted by the committee, and although it is certainly very natural that ministers should think them very reprehensible, it would be strange if this house should can sign them to condemnation but, it seems, that other speeches were made, aye, and of still greater violence speeches of such terrible and alarming import, that the right hon gent, is positively afraid of reading an extract to the house, although these same speeches have been already published in every newspaper while all this was going on, says he, we forbore still, although we had secret information of it secret information of it incomparable lenity admirable secresy we were watching their meetings we knew in our secret council all their operations our spies were at work we received accurate intelligence respecting every speech or motion that was made indeed o statesman like caution o wise and provident counsellors you did, then, succeed, by these mysterious channels, in making yourselves acquainted with what was known to every individual in dublin, and regularly published in the newspapers of the day a laugh, and cries of hear hear you became fully apprised, on the 10th of february, of mr hay's circular letter issued on the 1st of january, and of the resolutions passed at the catholic meeting on the 19th of the same mouth here read a report of the proceedings of the committee on the 19th then observe the great utility of this secret information the letter of the right hon gent, is prepared, with the advice of the lord chancellor and the attorney general why then not let the people know that these great law authorities had sanctioned it why keep them in the dark as to the source from which a measure of such severity had emanated with all the respect which i feel for lord manners, if he was the author of that letter, i will condemn it and pronounce it to be unwarranted by law omitting my first objection to it, i contend, that the part referring to attendance at catholic meetings, to be directly contrary to the law the right hon gent, says who ever heard of a proclamation in such a case, to enforce an act of the legislature it would have been well if on this point he had consulted his legal friends too, and he would then have found, that on the execution of any law, the object of which is to prevent popular insurrection, the government has uniformly given notice by proclamation of their intention the committee has been accused this night of a design to constitute itself a permanent assembly sir, it is, most satisfactory tome, and i am sure it must be satisfactory to the country to learn that in defence of the rigorous edict of the irish government, nothing more has been alledged against the catholic meetting than that they had appointed a committee of grievances i was afraid that, goaded by continued disappointment, and tired of unavailing supplication, they had been instigated to steps fatal to their cause, and deserving of the restraint and chastisement of government happy am i to find myself so utterly mistaken the right hon gent, tells us that, not with standing the retrospective operation of the convention act, implied by the letter of his mandate, that operation was not intended, by the irish government to be enforced we are now informed of this for the first, time it was therefore, i presume, another part of that notable secresy for which the right hon gent, has taken so much credit to himself but why was it necessary to make these superfluous threats he now says, he is sorry that many persons should have taken this measure in such bad part, or that they should feel any soreness on such an occasion but if he was really anxious to preserve harmony in the country, why did he not, before he thundered his anathema, send for some of the gentlemen of the committee, and warn them of the determination of government was it incumbent on him to contradict himself, and do acts only to reverse them, was it necessary for him to make a practical bull, in order to prove himself a good irishman i should have thought some, previous intimation, at least some amicable expostulation, to be a judicious preface to, such a letter as that of the right hon , an allusion has been made to a supposed, transaction when i was chancellor in ireland, and it has been said that there are rumours that it was the intention of the irish government at that time to have enforced the provisions of the convention act i must distinctly say, that while i held that office, i saw no manifestation whatever of any disposition which could render such a step necessary i did indeed admonish the committee to exercise the utmost discretion i entreated them not to throw away ad vantages, or put themselves in the power of their enemies i told them that no harsh or compulsive measures were contemplated, but that, if called on, government would do its duty i did at the same time dissuade them from preferring their petition, because it could not then have been successful, but would probably ruin the administration hear, hear i knew that it would furnish a pretext to those who were lying in wait for it, to raise a cry that should have the effect of overturning the ministry of that day hear, hear let the right hon gent, inquire into the circumstances of this statement, and discover whether it be correct i thought then, and i think still, that the catholics, if well advised, and pursuing temperate measures with firmness and perseverance, must ultimately succeed having, sir, said thus much, i shall now conclude, by reminding the right hon gentlemen opposite, that if they are confident in the justice of their case, they cannot refuse further information to the house, since in that case, the necessary
